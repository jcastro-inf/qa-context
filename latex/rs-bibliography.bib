Text filtering is an information seeking process in which documents are selected from a dynamic text stream to satisfy a relatively stable and specific information need. A model of the information seeking process is introduced and specialized to define text Altering. The historical development of text filtering is then reviewed and case studies of recent work are used to highlight important design characteristics of modern text filtering systems. User modeling techniques drawn from information retrieval, recommender systems, machine learning and other fields are described. The paper concludes with observations on the present state of the art and implications for future research on text filtering.}},

    abstract                   = {{The text recommendation task involves delivering sets of documents to users on the basis of user models. These models are improved over time, given feedback on the delivered documents. When selecting documents to recommend, a system faces an instance of the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. whether to deliver documents about which there is little certainty, or those which are known to match the user model learned so far. In this paper, a simulation is constructed to investigate the effects of this tradeoff on the rate of learning user models, and the resulting compositions of the sets of recommended documents, in particular World-Wide Web pages. Document selection strategies are developed which correspond to different points along the tradeoff. Using an exploitative strategy, our results show that simple preference functions can successfully be learned using a vector-space representation of a user model in conjunction with a gradient descent algorithm, but that increasingly complex preference functions lead to a slowing down of the learning process. Exploratory strategies are shown to increase the rate of user model acquisition at the expense of presenting users with suboptimal recommendations; in addition they adapt to user preference changes more rapidly than exploitative strategies. These simulated tests suggest an implementation for a simple control that is exposed to users, allowing them to vary a system's document selection behavior depending on individual circumstances.}},

We have previously proposed an approach for dealing with this task by processing performance data of the targeted software. This approach has been tested using a customized implementation referred to as PYTHIA. This experience made us realize the complexity of the algorithmic discovery of knowledge from performance data and of the management of these data together with the discovered knowledge. To address this issue, we created PYTHLA-II-a modular framework and system which combines a general knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) methodology and recommender system technologies to provide advice about scientific software/hardware artifacts. The functionality and effectiveness of the system is demonstrated for two existing performance studies using sets of software for solving partial differential equations. From the end-user perspective, PYTHIA-II allows users to specify the problem to be solved and their computational objectives. In turn, PYTHIA-II (i) selects the software available for the user's problem, (ii) suggests parameter values, and (iii) assesses the recommendation provided. PYTHIA-II provides all the necessary facilities to set up database schemas for testing suites and associated performance data in order to test sets of software. Moreover, it allows easy interfacing of alternative data mining and recommendation facilities. PYTHIA-II is an open-ended system implemented on public domain software and has been used for performance evaluation in several different problem domains.}},

We identify the research issues in mining such spaces, present a dynamic programming algorithm from the data-mining literature, and describe how a priori domain metaknowledge can be used to control the complexity of induction. A visualization aid for continuous-valued recommendation spaces is also outlined. Two case studies are presented to illustrate our approach and tools: (i) a comparison of an iterative and a direct linear system solver on nearly singular problems, and (ii) a comparison of two iterative solvers on problems posed on nonrectangular domains. Both case studies involve continuously varying problem and method parameters which strongly influence the choice of best algorithm in particular cases. By mining the results from thousands of PDE solves, we can gain valuable insight into the relative performance of these methods on similar problems.}},

The smart radio approach is to have people manage their music resources by putting together personalised music programmes. These programmes can then be swapped using techniques of collaborative recommendation to find similarities between users.

The recommender is meant to provide an alternative source of new ideas for customers who now visit the store less frequently. Recommendations are generated by matching products to customers based on the expected appeal of the product and the previous spending of the customer. Associations mining in the product domain is used to determine relationships among product classes for use in characterizing the appeal of individual products. Clustering in the customer domain is used to identify groups of shoppers with similar spending histories. Cluster-specific lists of popular products are then used as input to the matching process. The recommender is currently being used in a pilot program with several hundred customers. Analysis of results to date have shown a 1.8\% boost in program revenue as a result of purchases made directly from the list of recommended products. A substantial fraction of the accepted recommendations are from product classes new to the customer, indicating a degree of willingness to expand beyond present purchase patterns in response to reasonable suggestions.}},

This article reports on an experiment conducted using the ``AntWorld,{''} system a collaborative information finding system for the Internet, to explore the effect of added motivation on users' behavior.

Among these techniques, Content Based Filtering recommend new items by comparing them with a user profile, usually expressed as a set of items given by the user. This comparison is often performed using the k-NN method, which presents efficiency problems as the user profile grows. This paper presents an approach where each user profile is modeled by a meta-prototype and the comparison between an item and a profile is based on a suitable matching function. We show experimentally that our approach clearly outperforms the k-NN method while they presenting equal or even better prediction accuracy. The meta-prototype approach performs slightly worse than kd-tree speed up method but it exhibits a significant gain in prediction accuracy.}},

However, the exponentially increasing information provided by the Internet enterprises causes the problem of overloaded information, and this inevitably reduces the customer's satisfaction and loyalty. One way to overcome such a problem is to build personalized recommender systems to retrieve product information that really interests the customers. For products that people may purchase relatively often, such as books and CDs, recommender systems can be built to reason about a customer's personal preferences from his purchasing history and then provide the most appropriate information services to meet his needs. On the other hand, for those commodities a general customer does not buy frequently, for example computers and home theater systems, more appropriate are the kinds of recommender systems able to retrieve optimal products based on the customer's current preferences obtained from the iterative system-customer interactions. This paper presents the above two kinds of recommender systems we have developed for supporting Internet commerce. Experimental results show the promise of our systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Many recommender systems operate as interactive systems that seek feedback from the end-user as part of the recommendation process to revise the user's query. In this paper we examine different forms of feedback that have been used in the past and focus on a low-cost preference-based feedback model, which to date has been very much under utilised. In particular we describe and evaluate a novel comparison-based recommendation framework which is designed to utilise preference-based feedback. Specifically, we present results that highlight the benefits of a number of new query revision strategies and evidence to suggest that the popular more-like-this strategy may be flawed.}},

Recent research has shown that major gains in recommendation diversity can often be achieved at the expense of relatively small reductions in similarity. However, there are many domains in which it may not be acceptable to sacrifice similarity in the interest of diversity. To address this problem, we examine the conditions in which similarity can be increased without loss of diversity and present a new approach to retrieval which is designed to deliver such similarity-preserving increases in diversity when possible. We also present a more widely applicable approach to increasing diversity in which the requirement that similarity is fully preserved is relaxed to allow some loss of similarity, provided it is strictly controlled.}},

Typically in case-based reasoning (CBR) approaches to product recommendation, the items recommended are those that are most similar to a target query representing the elicited requirements of the user. Usually in practice, the user is required to specify a single preferred value for each attribute in the query. However, we argue that a more flexible approach to requirements elicitation is necessary to meet the needs of different users, ranging from those who know exactly what they are looking for to those whose requirements are vague in the extreme. We show how the standard approach to similarity-based retrieval can be generalised to support queries in which the user can enter any number of preferred values of a selected attribute, and examine the potential benefits of the approach.}},

However, the discovery of patterns from usage data by itself is not sufficient for performing the personalization tasks. The critical step is the effective derivation of good quality and useful (i.e., actionable) ``aggregate usage profiles{''} from these patterns. In this paper we present and experimentally evaluate two techniques, based on clustering of user transactions and clustering of pageviews, in order to discover overlapping aggregate profiles that can be effectively used by recommender systems for real-time Web personalization. We evaluate these techniques both in terms of the quality of the individual profiles generated, as well as in the context of providing recommendations as an integrated part of a personalization engine. In particular, our results indicate that using the generated aggregate profiles, we can achieve effective personalization at early stages of users' visits to a site, based only on anonymous clickstream data and without the benefit of explicit input by these users or deeper knowledge about them.}},

In the following paper, we look at its use in combating some of the traditional issues faced with recommender systems. We discuss our ongoing work which aims to enhance the performance of PTV, an applied recommender system working in the TV listings domain. This system currently combines the results of separate user-based collaborative and case-based components to recommend programs to users. Our extension to this idea operates on the theory of developing a case-based view of the collaborative component itself. By using data mining techniques to extract relationships between programme items, we can address the sparsity/maintenance problem. We also adopt a unique approach to recommendation ranking which combines user similarities and item similarities to provide more effective recommendation orderings. Experimental results corroborate our ideas, demonstrating the effectiveness of data mining in improving recommender systems by providing similarity knowledge to address sparsity, both at user-based recommendation level and recommendation ranking level.}},

However, in domains where items are frequently added, collaborative filtering encounters the latency problem. Characterized by the system's inability to select recently added items, the latency problem appears because new items in a collaborative filtering system must be reviewed before they can be recommended. Content-based filtering may help to counteract this problem, but runs the risk of only recommending items almost identical to the ones the user has appreciated before. In this paper, a combination of category-based filtering and user stereotype cases is proposed as a novel approach to reduce the latency problem. Category-based filtering puts emphasis on categories as meta-data to enable quicker personalization. User stereotype cases, identified by clustering similar users, are utilized to decrease response times and improve the accuracy of recommendations when user information is incomplete.}},

    abstract                   = {{We consider the problem of determining which of a set of experts has tastes most similar to a given user by asking the user questions about his likes and dislikes. We describe a simple algorithm for generating queries for a theoretical model of this problem. We show that the algorithm requires at most opt(F)(ln(|F|/ opt(F)) + 1) + 1 queries to find the correct expert, where opt( F) is the optimal worst-case bound on the number of queries for learning arbitrary elements of the set of experts F. The algorithm runs in time polynomial in | F| and | X| (where X is the domain) and we prove that no polynomial-time algorithm can have a significantly better bound on the number of queries unless all problems in NP have n(O(log log n)) time algorithms. We also study a more general case where the user ratings come from a finite set Y and there is an integer-valued loss function l on Y that is used to measure the distance between the ratings. Assuming that the loss function is a metric and that there is an expert within a distance. from the user, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find such an expert after at most 2opt(F,eta) ln |F|/1+deg(F, eta) +2(eta+1)(1 + deg(F, eta)) queries, where deg(F, eta) is the largest number of experts in F that are within a distance 2eta of any f is an element of F.}},

In our approach we model such preferences as strict partial orders with ``A is better than B{''} semantics, which has been proven to be very suitable in various e-applications. In this paper we present novel Preference Mining techniques for detecting strict partial order preferences in user log data. The main advantage of our approach is the semantic expressiveness of the Preference Mining results. Experimental evaluations prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms. Since the Preference Mining implementation uses sophisticated SQL statements to execute all data-intensive operations on database layer, our algorithms scale well even for large log data sets. With our approach personalized e-applications can gain valuable knowledge about their customers' preferences, which is essential for a qualified customer service.}},

By exploiting the concept of fuzzy similarity measures, this paper presents a recommendation framework that builds on the strengths of knowledge-based and collaborative filtering techniques. Following a multi-criteria approach, the proposed framework is able to provide users with a ranked list of alternatives, while it also pen-nits them to submit their evaluations on the existing objects of the database. Much attention is given to the extent in which the user evaluation may affect the values of the stored objects. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated through a web-based tool that provides recommendations about visiting different cities of a country.}},

Web usage mining populates the rating database by tracking customers' shopping behaviors on the Web, so leading to better quality recommendations. SVD is used to improve the performance of searching for nearest neighbors through dimensionality reduction of the rating database. Several experiments on real Web retailer data show that the proposed methodology provides higher quality recommendations and better performance than other recommendation methodologies.}},

However, as in the World Wide Web, the available TV programmes and their correspondingly electronic information within the increasing digital channels may cause the problem of information overload. Though the audience has more alternatives while choosing programmes, he also has to spend more and more time to read the on-line information about the programme contents or to browse different channels in order to decide what to watch. One way to overcome such a problem is to build intelligent recommender systems to provide personalized information services. By analyzing the information collected from the user, a personalized recommender system is able to reason his personal preferences and then choose the programmes for him.

We present a new approach to retrieval in which similarity and compromise play complementary roles, thereby increasing the likelihood that one of the retrieved cases will be acceptable to the user. We also show how the approach can be extended to address the requirements of domains in which the user is not just seeking a single item that closely matches her query, but would like to be informed of all items that are likely to be of interest.}},

In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art taxonomy of intelligent recommender agents on the Internet. We have analyzed 37 different systems and their references and have sorted them into a list of 8 basic dimensions. These dimensions are then used to establish a taxonomy under which the systems analyzed are classified. Finally, we conclude this paper with a cross-dimensional analysis with the aim of providing a starting point for researchers to construct their own recommender system.}},

Personal assistant agents embody a clearly beneficial application of intelligent agent technology. A particular kind of assistant agents, recommender systems, can be used to recommend items of interest to users. To be successful, such systems should be able to model and reason with user preferences for items in the application domain. Our primary concern is to develop a reasoning procedure that can meaningfully and systematically tradeoff between user preferences. We have adapted mechanisms from voting theory that have desirable guarantees regarding the recommendations generated from stored preferences. To demonstrate the applicability of our technique, we have developed a movie recommender system that caters to the interests of users. We present issues and initial results based on experimental data of our research that employs voting theory for user modeling, focusing on issues that are especially important in the context of user modeling. We provide multiple query modalities by which the user can pose unconstrained, constrained, or instance-based queries. Our interactive agent learns a user model by gaining feedback about its recommended movies from the user. We also provide pro-active information gathering to make user interaction more rewarding. In the paper, we outline the current status of our implementation with particular emphasis on the mechanisms used to provide robust and effective recommendations.}},

In some sense, such resource descriptions appear ``antisocial{''} as they do not reflect the social impact of the respective resource and therefore might not provide impartial, reliable assessments. E.g., commercial web sites do not contain any relationship to the information, service and product offers of competing sites, and the assessment, of the site by customers, experts or competitors is unknown to users and information agents also. We introduce an open multiagent system framework which derives multidimensional resource descriptions from the possibly conflicting opinions of interacting description agents, which act as representatives for individual, organizational or institutional clients, and compete in the, assertion of individual opinions against others to provide a ``socially enhanced{''} solution for this problem. In contrast to the results of majority voting based recommender systems, the obtained social resource descriptions reflect social structures such as norms and roles Which emerge from communication processes.}},

They have become fundamental application in electronic commerce and information access, provide suggestions that effective prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those item that best meet their needs and preferences. Collaborative filtering and content-based recommending are two fundamental techniques that have been proposed for performing recommendation. Both techniques have their own advantages however they cannot perform well in many situations. To improve performance, various hybrid techniques have been considered. This paper proposes a framework to improve the recommendation performance by combining content-based prediction based on Support Vector Machines and conventional collaborative filtering. The experimental results show that SVMs can improve the performance of the recommender system.}},

Product brokering in e-commerce is a typical example and systems which can recommend products to their users in a personalized manner have been studied rigoriously in recent years. Collaborative filtering is one of the commonly used approaches where careful choices of the user similarity measure and the rating style representation are required, and yet there is no guarantee for their optimality. In this paper, we propose the use of machine learning techniques to learn the user similarity as well as the rating style. A criterion function measuring the prediction errors is used and several problem formulations are proposed together with their learning algorithms. We have evaluated our proposed methods using the EachMovie dataset and succeeded in obtaining significant improvement in recommendation accuracy when compared with the standard correlation method.}},

Therefore, it is necessary that a fully personalized mobile advertising infrastructure be made. In this paper, we present such a personalized contextualized mobile advertising infrastructure for the advertisement of commercial/non-commercial activities. We name this infrastructure MALCR, in which the primary ingredient is a recommendation mechanism that is supported by the following concepts: (1) minimize users' inputs (a typical interaction metaphor for mobile devices) for implicit browsing behaviors to be best utilized; (2) implicit browsing behaviors are then analyzed with a view to understanding the users' interests in the values of features of advertisements; (3) having understood the users' interests, Mobile Ads relevant to a designated location are subsequently scored and ranked; (4) Top-N scored advertisements are recommended. The recommendation mechanism is novel in its combination of two-level Neural Network learning, Neural Network sensitivity analysis, and attribute-based filtering. This recommendation mechanism is also justified (by thorough evaluations) to show its ability in furnishing effective personalized contextualized mobile advertising. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Systems which can provide personalized product recommendations to their users (often called recommender systems) have gained a lot of interest in recent years. Collaborative filtering is one of the commonly used approaches which normally requires a definition of user similarity measure. In the literature, researchers have proposed different choices for the similarity measure using different approaches, and yet there is no guarantee for optimality. In this paper, we propose the use of machine learning techniques to learn the optimal user similarity measure as well as user rating styles for enhancing recommendation accuracy. Based on a criterion function measuring the overall prediction error, several ratings transformation functions for modeling rating styles together with their learning algorithms are derived. With the help of the formulation and the optimization framework, subjective components in user ratings are removed so that the transformed ratings can then be compared. We have evaluated our proposed methods using the EachMovie dataset and succeeded in obtaining significant improvement in recommendation accuracy when compared with the standard correlation-based algorithm.}},

Collaborative recommender systems utilize correlation between customer preference ratings to identify ``like-minded{''} customers and predict their product preference. One factor determining the success of the recommender systems is the prediction accuracy, which in many cases is limited by lacking adequate ratings (the sparsity problem). Recently, the use of latent class model (LCM) has been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we first study how the LCM can be extended to handle customers and,products outside the training set. In addition, we propose the use of a pair of LCMs (called dual latent class model-DLCM), instead of a single LCM, to model customers' likes and dislikes separately for enhancing We prediction accuracy. Experimental results based on the EachMovie dataset show that DLCM outperforms both LCM and the conventional correlation-based method when the available ratings are sparse.}},

To overcome the product overload of online shoppers, a variety of recommendation methods have been developed. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most successful recommendation method, but its widespread use has exposed some well-known limitations, such as sparsity and scalability, which can lead to poor recommendations. This paper proposes a recommendation methodology based on Web usage mining, and product taxonomy to enhance the recommendation quality and the system performance of current CF-based recommender systems. Web usage mining populates the rating database by tracking customers' shopping behaviors on the Web, thereby leading to better quality recommendations. The product taxonomy is used to improve the performance of searching for nearest neighbors through dimensionality reduction of the rating database. Several experiments on real e-commerce data show that the proposed methodology provides higher quality recommendations and better performance than other CF methodologies. (C) 2003. Elsevier Ltd.

Published algorithms focus more on the discrete user ratings instead of binary results, which hampers their predictive capabilities when usage data is sparse. The system proposed in this paper, e-VZpro, is an association mining-based recommender tool designed to overcome these problems through a two-phase approach. In the first phase, batches of customer historical data are analyzed through association mining in order to determine the association rules for the second phase. During the second phase, a scoring algorithm is used to rank the recommendations online for the customer. The second phase differs from the traditional approach and an empirical comparison between the methods used in e-VZpro and other collaborative filtering methods including dependency networks, item-based, and association mining is provided in this paper. This comparison evaluates the algorithms used in each of the above methods using two internal customer datasets and a benchmark dataset. The results of this comparison clearly show that e-VZpro performs well compared to dependency networks and association mining. In general, item-based algorithms with cosine similarity measures have the best performance.}},

However, most existing CF based recommender systems worked in a centralized way and suffered from its shortage in scalability as their calculation complexity increased quickly both in time and space when the record in user database increases. In this article, we first propose a distributed CF algorithm called PipeCF together with two novel approaches: significance refinement and unanimous amplification, to further improve the scalability and prediction accuracy. We then show how to implement this algorithm on a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) structure through distributed hash table method, which is the most popular and efficient P2P routing algorithm, to construct a scalable distributed recommender system. The experimental data show that the distributed CF-based recommender system has much better scalability than traditional centralized ones with comparable prediction efficiency and accuracy.

In this article, we describe a new family of model-based algorithms designed for this task. These algorithms rely on a statistical modelling technique that introduces latent class variables in a mixture model setting to discover user communities and prototypical interest profiles. We investigate several variations to deal with discrete and continuous response variables as well as with different objective functions. The main advantages of this technique over standard memory-based methods are higher accuracy, constant time prediction, and an explicit and compact model representation. The latter can also be used to mine for user communitites. The experimental evaluation shows that substantial improvements in accucracy over existing methods and published results can be obtained.}},

    abstract                   = {{Recommender systems are being widely applied in many application settings to suggest products, services, and information items to potential consumers. Collaborative filtering, the most successful recommendation approach, makes recommendations based on past transactions and feedback from consumers sharing similar interests. A major problem limiting the usefulness of collaborative filtering is the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation in which transactional or feedback data is sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests. In this article, we propose to deal with this sparsity problem by applying an associative retrieval framework and related spreading activation algorithms to explore transitive associations among consumers through their past transactions and feedback. Such transitive associations are a valuable source of information to help infer consumer interests and can be explored to deal with the sparsity problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted an experimental study using a data set from an online bookstore. We experimented with three spreading activation algorithms including a constrained Leaky Capacitor algorithm, a branch-and- bound serial symbolic search algorithm, and a Hopfield net parallel relaxation search algorithm. These algorithms were compared with several collaborative filtering approaches that do not consider the transitive associations: a simple graph search approach, two variations of the user-based approach, and an item-based approach. Our experimental results indicate that spreading activation-based approaches significantly outperformed the other collaborative filtering methods as measured by recommendation precision, recall, the F-measure, and the rank score. We also observed the over-activation effect of the spreading activation approach, that is, incorporating transitive associations with past transactional data that is not sparse may ``dilute{''} the data used to infer user preferences and lead to degradation in recommendation performance.}},

To demonstrate its usefulness and flexibility, we developed three recommendation methods: direct retrieval, association mining, and high-degree association retrieval. We used a data set from an online bookstore as our research test-bed. Evaluation results showed that combining product content information and historical customer transaction information achieved more accurate predictions and relevant recommendations than using only collaborative information. However, comparisons among different methods showed that high-degree association retrieval did not perform significantly better than the association mining method or the direct retrieval method in our test-bed.}},

The proposed method introduces indirect association rules complementing typical, direct rules, which, in the web environment, usually only confirm existing hyperlinks. The direct confidence, the basic measure of direct association rules, reflects pages' co-occurrence in common user sessions, while the indirect confidence exploits an additional, transitive page and relationships existing between, not within sessions. The complex confidence, combining both direct and indirect relationships, is engaged in the personalized process of product recommendation in e-commerce.

It is very important for a recommender system to predict accurately by analyzing customer's preferences. A recommender system utilizes in general an information filtering technique called collaborative filtering, which is based on the ratings of other customers who have similar preferences. Because a recommender system using collaborative filtering predicts customer's preferences based only on the items without useful information on the attributes of each item, it may not give high quality recommendation consistently to the customers. In this paper we show that exploiting the attributes of each item improves prediction quality. We analyze the dataset and retrieve the preferences for the attributes because they have not been rated by customers explicitly. In the experiment the MovieLens dataset of the GroupLens Research Center has been used. The results on various experiments using several neighbor selection methods which are quite popular techniques for recommender systems show that the recommender systems using the attributes provide better prediction qualities than the systems without using the attribute information. Each of the systems using the attributes has improved the prediction quality more than 9\%, compared with its counterpart. And the clustering-based recommender systems using the attributes can solve the very large-scale dataset problem without deteriorating prediction quality.}},

    abstract                   = {{Collaborative filtering systems employ statistical techniques to find a set of users known as neighbors, who have a history of agreeing with the target user. However, the problems associated with high dimensionality in the recommender systems have been discussed in several studies. In addition, the degree of correlation is computed between only two users. Although the preference correlation of two users may not be very high, their preferences can serve as useful data for preference prediction. The preference information of the two users, however, cannot be used to give a recommendation because the degree of their mutual correlation is low. The users preferences in Collaborative filtering systems are not necessarily accurate information. Carelessly entered information stored in the collaborative filtering database must be excluded. In this paper, Entropy is used for optimizing users. Bayesian classification shall be used to classify items to lower the dimension of the user-item matrix in this paper. To extract the features of items this paper uses association word mining. Since this method is representing document as a set of association words, it prevents users from being confused by word sense disambiguation. Also, the users can be put into clusters by using the genetic algorithm on the classified items to solve the problems of previous clustering algorithm such as the need to predefine the number of clusters, the high sensitivity to noise in data, and the possibility their resulting data would converge with the region's optimal solution. Finally, it predicts typical preferences by using entropy to solve the problem depending on the correlation match between only two users. The typical preferences mean pseudo preferences that represent preferences of items within the group. A dynamic recommendation for an item is made using the typical preference. To give dynamic recommendations to users, the process of classifying users receiving recommendations into the most suitable group takes precedence.}},

Such systems had been expected to have a bright future, especially in e-commerce and e-learning environments. However, although they have been intensively explored in the Web Mining and Machine Learning fields, and there have been some commercialized systems, the quality of the recommendation and the user satisfaction of such systems are still not optimal. In this paper, we investigate a novel web recommender system, which combines usage data, content data, and structure data in a web site to generate user navigational models. These models are then fed back into the system to recommend users shortcuts or page resources. We also propose an evaluation mechanism to measure the quality of recommender systems. Preliminary experiments show that our system can significantly improve the quality of web site recommendation.}},

RSs compute a user similarity between users and use it as a weight for the users' ratings. However they have many weaknesses, such as sparseness, cold start and vulnerability to attacks. We assert that these weaknesses can be alleviated using a Trust-aware system that takes into account the ``web of trust{''} provided by every user. Specifically, we analyze data from the popular Internet web site epin-jons.com. The dataset consists of 49290 users who expressed reviews (with rating) on items and explicitly specified their web of trust, i.e. users whose reviews they have consistently found to be valuable. We show that any two users have usually few items rated in common. For this reason, the classic RS technique is often ineffective and is not able to compute a user similarity weight for many of the users. Instead exploiting the webs of trust, it is possible to propagate trust and infer an additional weight for other users. We show how this quantity can be computed against, a larger number of users.}},

Costly annotations by experts are replaced by a distributed process where the users take the initiative. While the collaborative approach enables the collection of a vast amount of data, a new issue arises: the quality assessment. The elicitation of trust values among users, termed ``web of trust{''}, allows a twofold enhancement of Recommender Systems. Firstly, the filtering process can be informed by the reputation of users which can be computed by propagating trust. Secondly, the trust metrics can help to solve a problem associated with the usual method of similarity assessment, its reduced computability. An empirical evaluation on Epinions.com dataset shows that trust propagation can increase the coverage of Recommender Systems while preserving the quality of predictions. The greatest improvements are achieved for users who provided few ratings.}},

During the course of a ``conversation{''} with the user the recommender system will suggest certain products and use feedback from the user to refine future suggestions. Critiquing has proven to be a powerful and popular form of feedback. Critiques allow the user to express a preference over part of the feature-space; for example, in a vacation/travel recommender a user might indicate that they are looking for a ``less expensive{''} vacation than the one suggested, thereby critiquing the price feature. Usually the set of critiques that the user can chose from is fixed as part of the basic recommender interface. In this paper we will propose a more dynamic critiquing approach where high-quality critiques are automatically generated during each recommendation cycle from the remaining product-cases. We show that these dynamic critiques can lead to more efficient recommendation performance by helping the user to more rapidly focus in on the right region of the product-space.}},

A novel profile visualization approach is taken to acquire profile feedback. Research papers are classified using ontological classes and collaborative recommendation algorithms used to recommend papers seen by similar people on their current topics of interest. Two small-scale experiments, with 24 subjects over 3 months, and a large-scale experiment, with 260 subjects over an academic year, are conducted to evaluate different aspects of our approach. Ontological inference is shown to improve user profiling, external ontological knowledge used to successfully bootstrap a recommender system and profile visualization employed to improve profiling accuracy. The overall performance of our ontological recommender systems are also presented and favourably compared to other systems in the literature.}},

One limitation of current recommenders is that they are not portable. They can only run on large computers connected to the Internet. A second limitation is that they require the user to trust the owner of the recommender with personal preference data. Personal recommenders hold the promise of delivering high quality recommendations on palmtop computers, even when disconnected from the Internet. Further, they can protect the user's privacy by storing personal information locally, or by sharing it in encrypted form. In this article we present the new PocketLens collaborative filtering algorithm along with five peer-to-peer architectures for finding neighbors. We evaluate the architectures and algorithms in a series of offline experiments. These experiments show that Pocketlens can run on connected servers, on usually connected workstations, or on occasionally connected portable devices, and produce recommendations that are as good as the best published algorithms to date.}},

While some of them can be specified impartially, other descriptions might be biased by individual preferences or subjective utility, for example quality ratings or content synopsizes. Unfortunately, such assessments of distributed resources usually either solely reflect the requirements, opinion and preferences of the resource providers or single users, or they consist of plain, often overgeneralized ratings obtained from voting-based recommender systems.

We introduced the concept of robustness as a performance measure, which is defined as the ability of a system to provide consistent predictions in the presence of noise in the data. In this paper, we expand on our previous work by examining the effects of several neighbourhood formation schemes and similarity measures on system performance.

The personalized Electronic Programme Guide (pEPG) is one solution to this problem; it leverages artificial intelligence and user profiling techniques to learn about the viewing preferences of individual users in order to compile personalized viewing guides that fit their individual preferences. Very often the limited availability of profiling information is a key limiting factor in such personalized recommender systems. For example, it is well known that collaborative filtering approaches suffer significantly from the sparsity problem, which exists because the expected item-overlap between profiles is usually very low. In this article we address the sparsity problem in the Digital TV domain. We propose the use of data mining techniques as away of supplementing meagre ratings-based profile knowledge with additional item-similarity knowledge that can be automatically discovered by mining user profiles. We argue that this new similarity knowledge can significantly enhance the performance of a recommender system in even the sparsest of profile spaces. Moreover, we provide an extensive evaluation of our approach using two large-scale, state-of-the-art online systems-PTVPlus, a personalized TV listings portal and Fischlar, an online digital video library system.}},

In particular, we extend our earlier analyses to examine how measures of interestingness can be used to identify and analyse relative contributions of segments of similarity knowledge.

While research in recommender systems grew out of information retrieval and filtering, the topic has steadily advanced into a legitimate and challenging research area of its own. Recommender systems have traditionally been studied from a content-based filtering vs. collaborative design perspective. Recommendations, however, are not delivered within a vacuum, but rather cast within an informal community of users and social context. Therefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and thus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is under-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a connection-oriented perspective toward recommender systems research. We posit that recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended to connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or indirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data. Thus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring people together: explicitly or implicitly. Finally, user modeling and the connection-centric viewpoint raise broadening and social issues-such as evaluation, targeting, and privacy and trust-which we also briefly address.}},

However, despite the fact that many activities are carried out in groups, like going to the theater with friends, these systems are focused on recommending items for sole users. This brings out the need of systems capable of performing recommendations for groups of people, a domain that has received little attention in the literature. In this article we introduce a novel method of making collaborative recommendations for groups, based on models built using techniques from symbolic data analysis. After, we empirically evaluate the proposed method to see its behaviour for groups of different sizes and degrees of homogeneity, and compare the achieved results with both an aggregation-based methodology previously proposed and a baseline methodology.}},

For example, a user might ask for a `less expensive' restaurant in a restaurant recommender; `less expensive' is a critique over the price feature. The value of critiquing is that it is generally applicable over a wide range of domains and it is an effective means of focusing search. To date critiquing approaches have usually been limited to single-feature critiques, and this ultimately limits the degree to which a given critique can eliminate unsuitable cases. In this paper we propose extending the critiquing concept to cater for the possibility of compound critiques - critiques over multiple case features. We describe a technique for automatically generating useful compound critiques and demonstrate how this can significantly improve the performance of a conversational recommender system. We also argue that this generalised form of critiquing offers explanatory benefits by helping the user to better understand the structure of the recommendation space.}},

Results point out that bipolarity is closer to the human interpretation of opinions, which impacts the selection of recommended items.}},

In adaptive information filtering, this profile partially or completely acquired by automatic means. This paper investigates if profile generation can be partially acquired by automatic methods and partially by direct user involvement. The issue is explored through an empirical study of a simulated filtering system that mixes automatic and manual profile generation. The study covers several issues involved in mixed control. The first issue concerns if a machine-learned pro le can provide better filtering performance if generated from an initial explicit user profile. The second issue concerns if user involvement can improve on a system-generated or adapted profile. Finally, the relationship between filtering performance and user ratings is investigated. In this particular study the initial setup of a personal pro le was effective and yielded performance improvements that persisted after substantiate training. However, the study showed no correlation between users' ratings of profiles and profile filtering performance, and only weak indications that users could improve profiles that already had been trained on feedback.}},

However, no one technique is best for all users in all situations. To combat this, we have previously developed a market-based recommender system that allows multiple agents (each representing a different recommendation method or system) to compete with one another to present their best recommendations to the user. Our marketplace thus coordinates multiple recommender agents and ensures only the best recommendations are presented. To do this effectively, however, each agent needs to learn the users' interests and adapt its recommending behaviour accordingly. To this end, in this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning and Boltzmann exploration strategy that the recommender agents can use for these tasks. We then demonstrate that this strategy helps the agents to effectively obtain information about the users' interests which, in turn, speeds up the market convergence and enables the system to rapidly highlight the best recommendations.}},

In particular, we show that a probabilistic active learning method can be used to actively query the user, thereby solving the ``new user problem.{''} Furthermore, the probabilistic framework allows us to reduce the, computational cost of memory-based CF by working on a carefully selected subset of user profiles, while retaining high accuracy. We report experimental results based on two real-world data sets, which demonstrate that our proposed PMCF framework allows an accurate and efficient prediction of user preferences.}},

The k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method plays a central role in collaborative filtering by finding the k-nearest neighbors for a given user and employing them to predict the user's interests. This method suffers from problems of sparsity and nonscalability due to the sparseness of the user-item data set and the entire scan of such a data set in search of neighbors. These problems are solved with a matrix conversion method for compressing items into classes and an instance-selection method to narrow the scope of neighbor searching. The matrix conversion method avoids the ``cold start{''} problem and makes predictions more accurate. The instance-selection method improves the performance of prediction without sacrificing accuracy. Combining these two methods results in better accuracy and performance.}},

However, common similarity-based neighborhood forming techniques imply various drawbacks, rendering the conception of decentralized recommender systems virtually impossible. We advocate trust metrics and trust-driven neighborhood formation as an appropriate surrogate, and outline various additional benefits of harnessing trust networks for recommendation generation purposes. Moreover, we present an implementation of one suchlike trust-based recommender and perform empirical analysis to underpin its fitness when coupled with an intelligent, content-based filter.}},

This approach supports multiple dimensions, profiling information, and hierarchical aggregation of recommendations. The article also presents a multidimensional rating estimation method capable, of selecting two-dimensional segments of ratings pertinent to the recommendation context and applying standard collaborative filtering or other traditional two-dimensional rating estimation techniques to these segments. A comparison of the multidimensional and two-dimensional rating estimation approaches is made, and the tradeoffs between the two are studied. Moreover, the article introduces a combined rating estimation method, which identifies the situations where the MD approach outperforms the standard two-dimensional approach and uses the MD approach in those situations and the standard two-dimensional approach elsewhere. Finally, the article presents a pilot empirical study of the combined approach, using a multidimensional movie recommender system that was developed for implementing this approach and testing its performance.}},

This chapter survey's the state-of-the-art in Web personalization. We start by providing a description of the personalization process and a classification of the current approaches to Web personalization. We discuss the various sources of data available to personalization systems, the modelling approaches employed and the current approaches to evaluating these systems. A number of challenges faced by researchers developing these systems are described as are solutions to these challenges proposed in literature. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the open challenges that must be addressed by the research community if this technology is to make a positive impact on user satisfaction with the Web.}},

However, existing collaborative filtering (CF) systems are static, since they only incorporate information regarding whether a customer buys a product during a certain period and do not make use of the purchase sequences of customers. Therefore, the quality of the recommendations of the typical CF could be improved through the use of information on such sequences. In this study, we propose a new methodology for enhancing the quality of CF recommendation that uses customer purchase sequences. The proposed methodology is applied to a large department store in Korea and compared to existing CF techniques. Various experiments using real-world data demonstrate that the proposed methodology provides higher quality recommendations than do typical CF techniques, with better performance, especially with regard to heavy users.

On the basis of the results of an earlier user study in a mock-up of a shopping mall, we implemented an improved version of the shopping guide. A new user study with the improved system in a real shopping mall confirms in a much more realistic setting the generally positive user attitudes found in the earlier study. The new study also sheds further light on the usability issues raised by the system, some of which can also arise with other mobile guides and recommenders. One such issue concerns desire of users to be able to understand and second-guess the system's recommendations. This requirement led to the development of an explanation component for the decision-theoretic guide, which was evaluated in a smaller follow-up study in the shopping mall.}},

For those consumer electronic products, it is difficult and not necessary to reason a customer's previous preferences because there may not be enough information about the customer's past purchases and the customer may have his specific requirements in each single purchase.

The outcome is the delivery of page recommendations which are strictly related to the navigational purposes of visitors and their actual location within the cyberspace of the website.

In this paper we introduce the idea of recommending a user-defined collection of items where the user has implicitly encoded the relationships between the items. Automated collaborative filtering (ACF), a so-called `contentless' technique, has been widely used as a recommendation strategy for music items. However, its reliance on a global model of the user's interests makes it unsuited to catering for the user's local interests. We consider the context-sensitive task of building a compilation, a user-defined collection of music tracks. In our analysis, a collection is a case that captures a specific short-term information/music need. In an offline evaluation, we demonstrate how a case-completion strategy that uses short-term representations is significantly more effective than the ACF technique. We then consider the problem of recommending a compilation according to the user's most recent listening preferences. Using a novel on-line evaluation where two algorithms compete for the user's attention, we demonstrate how a knowledge-light case-based reasoning strategy successfully addresses this problem.}},

Collaborative filtering is a knowledge-discovery technique that can help guide readers to items of potential interest based on the experience of prior users. This study sought to determine the impact of collaborative filtering on navigation of a large, Web-based radiology knowledge resource. Materials and Methods. Collaborative filtering was applied to a collection of 1,168 radiology hypertext documents available via the Internet. An item-based collaborative filtering algorithm identified each document's six most closely related documents based on 248,304 page views in an 18-day period. Documents were amended to include links to their related documents, and use was analyzed over the next 5 days. Results. The mean number of documents viewed per visit increased from 1.57 to 1.74 (P < 0.0001). Conclusions. Collaborative filtering can increase a radiology information resource's utilization and can improve its usefulness and ease of navigation. The technique holds promise for improving navigation of large Internet-based radiology knowledge resources.}},

    abstract                   = {{Recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making personalized recommendations for products or services during a live interaction. These systems, especially collaborative filtering based on user, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the kinds of commodity to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. One of these challenges is ability of recommender systems to be adaptive to environment where users have many completely different interests or items have completely different content (We called it as Multiple interests and Multiple-content problem). Unfortunately, the traditional collaborative filtering systems can not make accurate recommendation for the two cases because the predicted item for active user is not consist with the common interests of his neighbor users. To address this issue we have explored a hybrid collaborative filtering method, collaborative filtering based on item and user techniques, by combining collaborative filtering based on item and collaborative filtering based on user together. Collaborative filtering based on item and user analyze the user-item matrix to identify similarity of target item to other items, generate similar items of target item, and determine neighbor users of active user for target item according to similarity of other users to active user based on similar items of target item. In this paper we firstly analyze limitation of collaborative filtering based on user and collaborative filtering based on item algorithms respectively and emphatically make explain why collaborative filtering based on user is not adaptive to Multiple-interests and Multiplecontent recommendation. Based on analysis, we present collaborative filtering based on item and user for Multiple-interests and Multiple-content recommendation. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the results and compare them with collaborative filtering based on user and collaborative filtering based on item, respectively. The experiments suggest that collaborative filtering based on item and user provide better recommendation quality than collaborative filtering based on user and collaborative filtering based on item dramatically.

Accordingly, improving the quality of a recommendation to fulfill customers' needs is important in fiercely competitive environments. Although various recommender systems have been proposed, few have addressed the lifetime value of a customer to a firm. Generally, customer lifetime value (CLV) is evaluated in terms of recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) variables. However, the relative importance among them varies with the characteristics of the product and industry. We developed a novel product recommendation methodology that combined group decision-making and data mining techniques. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to determine the relative weights of RFM variables in evaluating customer lifetime value or loyalty. Clustering techniques were then employed to group customers according to the weighted RFM value. Finally, an association rule mining approach was implemented to provide product recommendations to each customer group. The experimental results demonstrated that the approach outperformed one with equally weighted RFM and a typical collaborative filtering (CF) method. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Remaining conversant with all components in such a repository presents a significant challenge to developers. Indeed the retrieval of a particular component in this large search space may prove problematic. Further to this, the reuse of components developed in an Agile environment is likely to be hampered by the existence of little or no support materials. We propose to infer the need for a component and proactively recommend that component to the developer using a technique which is consistent with the principles of Agile methodologies. Our RASCAL recommender agent tracks usage histories of a group of developers to recommend to an individual developer components that are expected to be needed by that developer. Unlike many traditional recommender systems, we may recommend items that the developer has actually employed previously. We introduce a content-based filtering technique for ordering the set of recommended software components and present a comparative analysis of applying this technique to a number of collaborative filtering algorithms. We also investigate the relationship between the number of usage histories collected and recommendation accuracy. Our overall results indicate that RASCAL is a very promising tool for allowing developers discover reusable components at no additional cost.}},

As such, user feedback plays a critical role in the sense that it helps steer the search towards a ``good{''} recommendation. Ideally, the system should be capable of effectively interpreting the feedback the user provides, and subsequently responding by presenting them with a ``better{''} set of recommendations. In this paper we investigate a form of feedback known as critiquing. Although a large number of recommenders axe well suited to this form of feedback, we argue that on its own it can lead to inefficient recommendation dialogs.

Recommender websites generally propose an aggregation of the user's evaluations critics according to different relevant criteria w.r.t. the application. The authors propose an Information Processing System (IPS) to collect, process and manage as automatically as possible these opinions or critics to support this multi criteria evaluation for recommendation. The RS (Recommender System) firstly proposes information extraction techniques in order to classify the available users' critics w.r.t. the criteria implied in the evaluation process and to automatically associate numerical scores to these critics. Then multicriteria techniques are introduced to numerically evaluate, compare and rank the competing movies the critics are reported to. Finally the RS is presented as an interactive Decision-Making Support System (DMSS) relying on a sensibility analysis of the movies ranking. A particular attention is paid to the automation of the information phase in the decision-making process: movie comments cartography according to users' evaluation criteria and attribution of a partial score to each critic considered as the expression of a value judgment in natural language.}},

However, content-based recommender system research has begun to look towards more conversational models of recommendation, where the user is actively engaged in directing search at recommendation time. Such interactions can range from high-level dialogues with the user, possibly in natural language, to more simple interactions where the user is, for example, asked to indicate a preference for one of k suggested items. Importantly, the feedback attained from these interactions can help to differentiate between the user's long-term stored preferences, and her current (short-term) requirements, which may be quite different. We argue that such interactions can also be beneficial to collaborative recommendation and provide experimental evidence to support this claim.}},

This ability is especially important in interactive CBR recommender systems because to be successful these systems must build trust with their users. This often means helping users to understand the reasons behind a particular recommendation, and presenting them with explanations, and confidence information is an important way, to achieve this. In this paper we propose an explicit model of confidence for conversational recommendation systems. We explain how confidence can be evaluated at the feature-level, during each cycle of a recommendation session, and how this can be effectively communicated to the user. In turn, we also show how case-level confidence can be usefully incorporated into the recommendation logic to guide the recommender in the direction of more confident suggestions.}},

Conversational recommender systems guide users through a product space, alternatively making product suggestions and eliciting user feedback. Critiquing is a common and powerful form of feedback, where a user can express her feature preferences by applying a series of directional critiques over recommendations, instead of providing specific value preferences. For example, a user might ask for a `less expensive' vacation in a travel recommender; thus `less expensive' is a critique over the price feature. The expectation is that on each cycle, the system discovers more about the user's soft product preferences from minimal information input. In this paper we describe three different strategies for knowledge discovery from user preferences that improve recommendation efficiency in a conversational system using critiquing. Moreover, we will demonstrate that while the strategies work well separately, their combined effort has the potential to considerably increase recommendation efficiency even further.}},

We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential optimization problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a more appropriate model for recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation and the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based recommender system must employ a strong initial model, must be solvable quickly, and should not consume too much memory. In this paper, we describe our particular MDP model, its initialization using a predictive model, the solution and update algorithm, and its actual performance on a commercial site. We also describe the particular predictive model we used which outperforms previous models. Our system is one of a small number of commercially deployed recommender systems. As far as we know, it is the first to report experimental analysis conducted on a real commercial site. These results validate the commercial value of recommender systems, and in particular, of our MDP-based approach.}},

Collaborative filtering is the most popular technique in implementing a recommender system. Association rule mining is a powerful data mining method to search for interesting relationships between items by finding the items frequently appeared together in a transaction database. In this paper, we apply quantitative association rules to mining the relationships between items, and then utilize the relationships between items to alleviate the data sparsity problem in the neighborhood-based algorithms. The proposed method considers not only similarities between users, but also similarities between items. The experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that our algorithm outperforms the conventional Pearson method and adjusted cosine method.}},

Given this, multiple recommendation methods have been developed. However, it has been shown that no one technique is best for all users in all situations. Thus we believe that effective recommender systems should incorporate a wide variety of such techniques and that some form of overarching framework should be put in place to coordinate the various recommendations so that only the best of them (from whatever source) are presented to the user. To this end, we show that a marketplace, in which the various recommendation methods compete to offer their recommendations to the user, can be used in this role. Specifically, this article presents the principled design of such a marketplace (including the auction protocol, the reward mechanism, and the bidding strategies of the individual recommendation agents) and evaluates the market's capability to effectively coordinate multiple methods. Through analysis and simulation, we show that our market is capable of shortlisting recommendations in decreasing order of user perceived quality and of correlating the individual agent's internal quality rating to the user's perceived quality.}},

The diversity and time-dependent evolving nature of user interests are creating difficulties in constructing and maintaining a sound user profile. This paper presents a simple but effective model, by using improved growing cell structures (M), to address this problem. The GCS is a kind of self-organizing map neural network with changeable network structure. By virtue of the clustering and structure adaptation capability of GCS, the proposed model maps the problem of learning and keeping track of user interests into a clustering and cluster-maintaining problem. Each cluster found by GCS represents an interest category of a user and the cluster maintaining, including cluster addition and deletion, corresponds to the addition of user's new interests and the removal of user's old interests. The proposed model has been validated by a set of experiments performed on a benchmark dataset. Results from experiments show that our model provides reasonable performance and high adaptability for learning user multiple interests and their changes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract                   = {{The paper proposes two case-based methods for recommending decisions to users on the basis of information stored in a database. In both approaches, fuzzy sets and related (approximate) reasoning techniques are used for modeling user preferences and decision principles in a flexible manner. The first approach, case-based decision making, can principally be seen as a case-based counterpart to classical decision principles well-known from statistical decision theory. The second approach, called case-based elicitation, combines aspects from flexible querying of databases and case-based prediction. Roughly, imagine a user who aims at choosing an optimal alternative among a given set of options. The preferences with respect to these alternatives are formalized in terms of flexible constraints, the expression of which refers to cases stored in a database. As both types of decision support might provide useful tools for recommender systems, we also place the methods in a broader context and discuss the role of fuzzy set theory in some related fields.}},

A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendations, including content-based and collaborative techniques. Content-based filtering selects information based on semantic content, whereas collaborative filtering combines the opinions of other users to make a prediction for a target user. In this paper, we describe a new filtering approach that combines the content-based filter and collaborative filter to capitalize on their respective strengths, and thereby achieves a good performance. We present a series of recommendations on the selection of the appropriate factors and also look into different techniques for calculating user-user similarities based on the integrated information extracted from user profiles and user ratings. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our approach and compare it with classic filters, the result of which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.}},

We propose two approaches: one relying on lifestyle alone and another integrating lifestyle within the nearest neighbor approach. Both approaches are empirically tested in the domain of recommendations for personalized television advertisements and are shown to outperform existing nearest neighborhood approaches in most cases.

In particular, we model the decay of emotion over time and assimilation effects, where the affective state produced by previous items influences the impact on satisfaction of the next item. We compare the algorithms with each other, and investigate the effect of parameter values by comparing the algorithms' predictions with the results of an earlier empirical study. We discuss the difficulty of evaluating affective models, and present an experiment in a learning domain to show how some empirical evaluation can be done. Secondly, this paper proposes modifications to the algorithms to deal with the effect on an individual's satisfaction of that of others in the group. In particular, we model emotional contagion and conformity, and consider the impact of different relationship types. Thirdly, this paper explores the issue of privacy (feeling safe, not accidentally disclosing private tastes to others in the group) which is related to the emotion of embarrassment. It investigates the effect on privacy of different group aggregation strategies and proposes to add a virtual member to the group to further improve privacy.}},

These vulnerabilities mostly emanate from the open nature of such systems and their reliance on user-specified judgments for building profiles. Attackers can easily introduce biased data in an attempt to force the system to ``adapt{''} in a manner advantageous to them. Our research in secure personalization is examining a range of attack models, from the simple to the complex, and a variety of recommendation techniques. In this chapter, we explore an attack model that focuses on a subset of users with similar tastes and show that such an attack can be highly successful against both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering. We also introduce a detection model that can significantly decrease the impact of this attack.}},

    abstract                   = {{A user that navigates on the Web using different devices should be characterized by a global profile, which represents his behaviour when using all these devices. Then, the user's profile could be usefully exploited when interacting with a site agent that is able to provide useful recommendations on the basis of the user's interests, on one hand, and to adapt the site presentation to the device currently exploited by the user, on the other hand. However, it is not suitable to construct such a global profile by a software running on the exploited device since this device (e.g., a mobile phone or a palmtop) may have limited resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-agent architecture, called MASHA, handling user and device adaptivity of Web sites, in which each device is provided with a client agent that autonomously collects information about the user's behaviour associated to just that device. However, the user profile contained in this client is continuously updated with information coming from a unique server agent, associated with the user. Such information is collected by the server agent from the different devices exploited by the user, and represents a global user profile. The third component of this architecture, called adapter agent, is capable to generate a personalized representation of the Web site, containing some useful recommendations derived by both an analysis of the user profile and the suggestions coming from other users exploiting the same device.}},

Usually collaborative filtering methods, like e.g. the Pearson correlation coefficient algorithm, are used to detect customers with a similar taste concerning some items. These customers serve as recommenders for other users. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for a recommender system that is based on user preferences, which may be mined from log data in a database system. Our notion of user preferences adopts a very powerful preference model from database systems. An evaluation of our prototype system suggests that our prediction quality can compete with the widely-used Pearson-based approach. In addition, our approach can achieve an added value, because it yields better results when there are only a few recommenders available. As a unique feature, preference- based recommender systems can deal with multi-attribute recommendations.}},

We conjecture that the weaknesses are due to a lack of inductive bias in the learning methods used to build the prediction models. We propose a new method that extends the utility model and assumes that the structure of user preferences follows an ontology of product attributes. Using the data of the MovieLens system, we show experimentally that real user preferences indeed closely follow an ontology based on movie attributes. Furthermore, a recommender based just on a single individual's preferences and this ontology performs better than collaborative filtering, with the greatest differences when little data about the user is available. This points the way to how proper inductive bias can be used for significantly more powerful recommender systems in the future.}},

Goal-based structuring is based on the fact that people experience certain gratifications from using information, which should match with their goals. An experiment using an electronic TV guide shows that structuring information using a goal-based structure makes it easier for users to find interesting information, especially if the goals are used explicitly; this is independent of whether recommendations are used or not. It also shows that goal-based structuring has more influence on how easy it is for users to find interesting information than recommendations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Most current browsers offer a facility to locally store and manage bookmarks in a hierarchy of folders; though, with growing size, users reportedly have trouble to create and maintain a stable organization structure. This paper presents a novel collaborative approach to case bookmark management, especially the ``classification{''} of new bookmarks into a folder. We propose a methodology to realize the collaborative classification idea of considering how similar users have classified a bookmark. A combination of nearest-neighbor-classifiers is used to derive a recommendation from similar users on where to store a new bookmark. A prototype system called CariBo has been implemented as a plugin for the central bookmark server software SiteBar. All findings have been evaluated on a reasonably large scale, real user dataset with promising results, and possible implications for shared and social bookmarking systems are discussed.

    abstract                   = {{Recommender systems anticipate users' needs by suggesting items that are likely to interest them. Most existing systems employ collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, searching for regularities in the way users have rated items. While in general a successful approach, CF cannot cope well with so-called one-and-only items, that is: items of which there is only one single instance (like an event), and which as such cannot be repetitively ``sold{''}. Typically such items are evaluated only after they have ceased being available, thereby thwarting the classical CF strategy. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework for recommending one-and-only items. It uses fuzzy logic, which allows to reflect the graded/uncertain information in the domain, and to extend the CF paradigm, overcoming limitations of existing techniques. A possible application in the context of trade exhibition recommendation for e-government is discussed to illustrate the proposed conceptual framework. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

We have also introduced three different areas where collaborative modelling can be further improved. For the first phase of testing, we have created a hybrid system based on three different collaborative recommender techniques. Since this system implements multiple collaboration techniques, we decided to call this approach Combined Collaborative Recommender. Although each prediction technique can produce adequate results, we have proved that the combination of these techniques into a unified system provides a much more stable system. It should also be pointed out that these analyses were done using a very large dataset (more than 2 million ratings) providing reliable results. Results of these optimisations are presented along with pointers for further development. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

There have been a substantial number of studies to make recommender systems more accurate and efficient, however, most of them have a common critical limitation - these systems are used as virtual salespeople, rather than as marketing tools. A crucial reason for this phenomenon is that the models suggested by prior studies only focus on a user's behavioral outcomes without consideration of the embedded procedure. In this study, we propose a novel recommender system based on user's behavioral model. Our proposed system, labeled VCR virtual community recommender, recommends optimal virtual communities for an active user by case-based reasoning (CBR) using behavioral factors suggested in the technology acceptance model (TAM) and its extended models. In addition, it refines its recommendation results by considering the user's needs type at the point of usage. To test the usefulness of our recommendation model, we conducted two-step validation-empirical validation for the collected data set, and practical validation to investigate the actual satisfaction level of users. Experimental results showed that our model outperformed all comparative models from the perspective of user satisfaction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

One of the most widely used recommendation methods is collaborative filtering that exploits the assumption that users who have agreed in the past in their ratings on observed items will eventually agree in the future. Despite the success of recommendation methods and collaborative filtering in particular, in real-world applications they suffer from the insufficient number of available ratings, which significantly affects the accuracy of prediction. In this paper, we propose recommendation approaches that follow the collaborative filtering reasoning and utilize the notion of lifestyle as an effective user characteristic that can group consumers in terms of their behavior as indicated in consumer behavior and marketing theory. Emanating from a basic lifestyle-based recommendation algorithm we incrementally proceed to the development of hybrid recommendation approaches that address certain dimensions of the sparsity problem and empirically evaluate them providing further evidence of their effectiveness.}},

We analyze how user behavior varies within user communities defined by a recommendation network. Product purchases follow a `long tail' where a significant share of purchases belongs to rarely sold items. We establish how the recommendation network grows over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the sender and receiver of the recommendations. While on average recommendations are not very effective at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, we present a model that successfully identifies communities, product, and pricing categories for which viral marketing seems to be very effective.}},

Music recommendation is considered a popular application area. In order to make personalized recommendations, many collaborative music recommender systems (CMRS) focus on capturing precise similarities among users or items based on user historical ratings. Despite the valuable information from audio features of music itself, however, few studies have investigated how to utilize information extracted directly from music for personalized recommendation in CMRS. In this paper, we describe a CMRS based on our proposed item-based probabilistic model, where items are classified into groups and predictions are made for users considering the Gaussian distribution of user ratings. In addition, this model has been extended for improved recommendation performance by utilizing audio features that help alleviate three well-known problems associated with data sparseness in collaborative recommender systems: user bias, non-association, and cold start problems in capturing accurate similarities among items. Experimental results based on two real-world data sets lead us to believe that content information is crucial in achieving better personalized recommendation beyond user ratings. We further show how primitive audio features can be combined into aggregate features for the proposed CRMS and analyze their influences on recommendation performance. Although this model was developed originally for music collaborative recommendation based on audio features, our experiment with the movie data set demonstrates that it can be applied to other domains.

Towards this direction, this paper identifies a set of dimensions that distinguish, describe and categorize multi-criteria recommender systems, based on existing taxonomies and categorizations. These dimensions are integrated into an overall framework that is used for the analysis and classification of a sample of existing multi-criteria recommender systems.

In this paper, the experimental analysis of several design options for three proposed multiattribute utility collaborative filtering algorithms is presented for a particular application context (recommendation of e-markets to online customers), under conditions similar to the ones expected during actual operation. The results of this study indicate that the performance of recommendation algorithms depends on the characteristics of the application context, as these are reflected on the properties of evaluations' data set. Therefore, it is judged important to experimentally analyze various design choices for multicriteria recommender systems, before their actual deployment.}},

Attackers, who cannot be readily distinguished from ordinary users, may inject biased profiles in an attempt to force a system to ``adapt{''} in a manner advantageous to them. Such attacks may lead to a degradation of user trust in the objectivity and accuracy of the system. Recent research has begun to examine the vulnerabilities and robustness of different collaborative recommendation techniques in the face of ``profile injection{''} attacks. In this article, we outline some of the major issues in building secure recommender systems, concentrating in particular on the modeling of attacks and their impact on various recommendation algorithms. We introduce several new attack models and perform extensive simulation-based evaluations to show which attacks are most successful and practical against common recommendation techniques. Our study shows that both user-based and item-based algorithms are highly vulnerable to specific attack models, but that hybrid algorithms may provide a higher degree of robustness. Using our formal characterization of attack models, we also introduce a novel classification-based approach for detecting attack profiles and evaluate its effectiveness in neutralizing attacks.}},

The quality of this aggregation process crucially affects the user experience and hence the effectiveness of recommenders in e-commerce. We present a characterization of nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering that allows us to disaggregate global recommender performance measures into contributions made by each individual rating. In particular, we formulate three roles-scouts, promoters, and connectors-that capture how users receive recommendations, how items get recommended, and how ratings of these two types are themselves connected, respectively. These roles find direct uses in improving recommendations for users, in better targeting of items and, most importantly, in helping monitor the health of the system as a whole. For instance, they can be used to track the evolution of neighborhoods, to identify rating subspaces that do not contribute ( or contribute negatively) to system performance, to enumerate users who are in danger of leaving, and to assess the susceptibility of the system to attacks such as shilling. We argue that the three rating roles presented here provide broad primitives to manage a recommender system and its community.}},

As is the case with all open systems, however, it is difficult to establish the integrity of those who access a system and thus the potential for malicious attack exists. In this paper we investigate the robustness of the I-SPY system to attack. In particular, we consider attack scenarios whereby malicious agents seek to promote particular result pages within a community. In addition, we analyse robustness in the context of community homogeneity, and we show that this key characteristic of communities has implications for system robustness.}},

The limited resources in these systems make minimizing their context acquisition a practical need, and the uncertainty in the mobile environment makes missing and erroneous context inputs a major concern. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Bayesian networks (BNs) for building recommender systems that minimize context acquisition. Our learning approach iteratively trims the BN-based context model until it contains only the minimal set of context parameters that are important to a user. In addition, we show that a two-tiered context model can effectively capture the causal dependencies among context parameters, enabling a recommender system to compensate for missing and erroneous context inputs. We have validated our proposed techniques on a restaurant recommendation data set and a Web page recommendation data set. In both benchmark problems, the minimal sets of context can be reliably discovered for the specific users. Furthermore, the learned Bayesian network consistently outperforms the J4.8 decision tree in overcoming both missing and erroneous context inputs to generate significantly more accurate predictions.}},

Unfortunately, current recommender systems suffer from various privacy-protection vulnerabilities. Customers should be able to keep private their personal information, including their buying preferences, and they should not be tracked against their will. The commercial interests of merchants should also be protected by allowing them to make accurate recommendations without revealing legitimately compiled valuable information to third parties. We introduce a theoretical approach for a system called Alambic, which achieves the above privacy-protection objectives in a hybrid recommender system that combines content-based, demographic and collaborative filtering techniques. Our system splits customer data between the merchant and a semi-trusted third party, so that neither can derive sensitive information from their share alone. Therefore, the system could only be subverted by a coalition between these two parties.}},

    abstract                   = {{The main strengths of collaborative filtering (CF), the most successful and widely used filtering technique for recommender systems, are its cross-genre or `outside the box' recommendation ability and that it is completely independent of any machine-readable representation of the items being recommended. However, CF suffers from sparsity, scalability, and loss of neighbor transitivity. CF techniques are either memory-based or model-based. While the former is more accurate, its scalability compared to model-based is poor. An important contribution of this paper is a hybrid fuzzy-genetic approach to recommender systems that retains the accuracy of memory-based CF and the scalability of model-based CF. Using hybrid features, a novel user model is built that helped in achieving significant reduction in system complexity, sparsity, and made the neighbor transitivity relationship hold. The user model is employed to find a set of like-minded users within which a memory-based search is carried out. This set is much smaller than the entire set, thus improving system's scalability. Besides our proposed approaches are scalable and compact in size, computational results reveal that they outperform the classical approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

To overcome this drawback, we have developed a domain-independent personalization strategy that borrows reasoning techniques from the Semantic Web, elaborating recommendations based on the semantic relationships inferred between the user's preferences and the available items. Our reasoning-based approach improves the quality of the suggestions offered by the current personalization approaches, and greatly reduces their most severe limitations. To validate these claims, we have carried out a case study in the Digital TV field, in which our strategy selects TV programs interesting for the viewers from among the myriad of contents available in the digital streams. Our experimental evaluation compares the traditional approaches with our proposal in terms of both the number of TV programs suggested, and the users' perception of the recommendations. Finally, we discuss concerns related to computational feasibility and scalability of our approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

In this paper, we present a strategy that overcomes overspecialization by applying reasoning techniques borrowed from the Semantic Web. Thanks to the reasoning, our strategy discovers a huge amount of knowledge about the user's preferences, and compares them with available products in a more flexible way, beyond the conventional syntactic metrics. Our reasoning-based strategy has been implemented in a recommender system for Interactive Digital Television, with which we checked that the proposed technique offers accurate enhanced suggestions that would go unnoticed in the traditional approaches.}},

Traditionally, recommendations are provided to customers depending on purchase probability and customers' preferences, without considering the profitability factor for sellers. This study attempts to integrate the profitability factor into the traditional recommender systems. Based on this consideration, we propose two profitability-based recommender systems called CPPRS (Convenience plus Profitability Perspective Recommender System) and HPRS (Hybrid Perspective Recommender System). Moreover, comparisons between our proposed systems (considering both purchase probability and profitability) and traditional systems (emphasizing an individual's preference) are made to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of these systems in terms of recommendation accuracy and/or profit from cross-selling. The experimental results show that the proposed HPRS can increase profit from cross-selling without losing recommendation accuracy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

This approach uncovers associations between customer types and product genres that frequently occurred in previous transaction records. Customer types are defined in terms of demographic attribute values that can be aggregated through concept hierarchies; product types can be generalized through product taxonomies. We use generalized profile-association rules (GP association rules) to identify the advertising targets for a given new product. In addition, we propose two algorithms-GP-Apriori and Merge-prune-to mine GP association rules and develop a value-based targeted advertising algorithm to select prospective customers of a new product on the basis of the discovered rules.

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender.}},

We propose to represent the mutual similarities of the recommended products in a two dimensional map, where similar products are located close to each other and dissimilar products far apart. As a dissimilarity measure we use an adaptation of Gower's similarity coefficient based on the attributes of a product. Two recommender systems are developed that use this approach. The first, the graphical recommender system, uses a description given by the user in terms of product attributes of an ideal product. The second system, the graphical shopping interface, allows the user to navigate towards the product she wants. We show a prototype application of both systems to MP3-players. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Recommender systems have been popularly used for reducing information overload of internet surfers by suggesting products or digital contents that are most valuable for them. But most existing recommender systems have been worked in client-server architecture. This paper proposes a PEOR (PEer-ORiented Recommender system), a collaborative filtering-based multimedia contents recommender system in P2P architecture, to obtain the peers' search efficiency. To adopt a change in peer preferences PEOR uses recent ratings of peers for recommendations, thereby leading to better quality recommendations. And to enhance the system performance, PEOR searches for nearest peers with similar preference through peer-based local information only. We implemented the system and evaluated its performance with real transaction data in S content provider offering character images. Our experimental data shows that PEOR offers not only remarkably higher quality of recommendations but also the dramatically faster performance than the centralized benchmark system.

Collaborative filtering is a widely used method of providing recommendations using explicit ratings on items from users. In some e-commerce environments, however, it is difficult to collect explicit feedback data; only implicit feedback is available. In this paper, we present a method of building an effective collaborative filtering-based recommender system for an e-commerce environment without explicit feedback data. Our method constructs pseudo rating data from the implicit feedback data. When building the pseudo rating matrix, we incorporate temporal information such as the user's purchase time and the item's launch time in order to increase recommendation accuracy. Based on this method, we built both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering-based recommender systems for character images (wallpaper) in a mobile e-commerce environment and conducted a variety of experiments. Empirical results show our time-incorporated recommender system is significantly more accurate than a pure collaborative filtering system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

These shops usually offer a wide range of items that cover the necessities of a great variety of users. Nevertheless, searching in such a wide range of items could be a very difficult and time-consuming task. Recommender systems assist users to find out suitable items by means of recommendations based on information provided by different sources such as: other users, experts, item features, etc. Most of the recommender systems force users to provide their preferences or necessities using an unique numerical scale of information fixed in advance. In spite of this information is usually related to opinions, tastes and perceptions, therefore, it seems that is usually better expressed in a qualitative way, with linguistic terms, than in a quantitative way, with precise numbers. We propose a Knowledge Based Recommender System that uses the fuzzy linguistic approach to define a flexible framework to capture the uncertainty of the user's preferences. Thus, this framework will allow users to express their necessities in scales closer to their own knowledge, and different from the scale utilized to describe the items.}},

Evaluation of various proposed technologies is essential for further development in this area. This paper describes the design and implementation of two user studies in which a particular product search tool, known as example critiquing, was evaluated against a chosen baseline model. The results confirm that example critiquing significantly reduces users' task time and error rate while increasing decision accuracy. Additionally, the results of the second user study show that a particular implementation of example critiquing also made users more confident about their choices. The main contribution is that through these two user studies, an evaluation framework of three criteria was successfully identified, which can be used for evaluating general product search and recommender systems in E-commerce environments. These two experiments and the actual procedures also shed light on some of the most important issues which need to be considered for evaluating such tools, such as the preparation of materials for evaluation, user task design, the context of evaluation, the criteria, the measures and the methodology of result analyses.}},

CF recommenders are being widely adopted for e-commerce applications to assist users in finding and selecting items of interest. As a result, the scalability of CF recommenders presents a significant challenge; one that is particularly resilient because the volume of data these systems utilize will continue to increase over time. This paper examines the impact of discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) as an approach to enhance the scalability of memory-based collaborative filtering recommender systems. In particular, a wavelet transformation methodology is proposed and applied to both synthetic and real-world recommender ratings. For experimental purposes, the DWT methodology's effect on predictive accuracy and calculation speed is evaluated to compare recommendation quality and performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There exist various recommendation techniques, including collaborative filtering (CF), content-based filtering, WRFM-based method, and hybrid methods. The CF method generally utilizes past purchasing preferences to determine recommendations to a target customer based on the opinions of other similar customers. The WRFM-based method makes recommendations based on weighted customer lifetime value - Recency, Frequency and Monetary. This work proposes to use customer demands derived from frequently purchased products in each industry as valuable information for making recommendations. Different from conventional CF techniques, this work uses extended preferences derived by combining customer demands and past purchasing preferences to identify similar customers. Accordingly, this work proposes several hybrid recommendation approaches that combine collaborative filtering, WRFM-based method, and extended preferences. The proposed approaches further utilize customer demands to adjust the ranking of recommended products to improve recommendation quality. The experimental results show that the proposed methods perform better than several other recommendation methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

    abstract                   = {{Background: The Bluejay genome browser has been developed over several years to address the challenges posed by the ever increasing number of data types as well as the increasing volume of data in genome research. Beginning with a browser capable of rendering views of XML-based genomic information and providing scalable vector graphics output, we have now completed version 1.0 of the system with many additional features. Our development efforts were guided by our observation that biologists who use both gene expression profiling and comparative genomics gain functional insights above and beyond those provided by traditional per-gene analyses. Results: Bluejay 1.0 is a genome viewer integrating genome annotation with: (i) gene expression information; and (ii) comparative analysis with an unlimited number of other genomes in the same view. This allows the biologist to see a gene not just in the context of its genome, but also its regulation and its evolution. Bluejay now has rich provision for personalization by users: (i) numerous display customization features; (ii) the availability of waypoints for marking multiple points of interest on a genome and subsequently utilizing them; and (iii) the ability to take user relevance feedback of annotated genes or textual items to offer personalized recommendations. Bluejay 1.0 also embeds the Seahawk browser for the Moby protocol, enabling users to seamlessly invoke hundreds of Web Services on genomic data of interest without any hard-coding. Conclusion: Bluejay offers a unique set of customizable genome-browsing features, with the goal of allowing biologists to quickly focus on, analyze, compare, and retrieve related information on the parts of the genomic data they are most interested in. We expect these capabilities of Bluejay to benefit the many biologists who want to answer complex questions using the information available from completely sequenced genomes.}},

Bayesian networks (BNs), one of the most frequently used classifiers, can be used for CF tasks. Previous works on applying BNs to CF tasks were mainly focused on binary-class data, and used simple or basic Bayesian classifiers. 1,2 In this work, we apply advanced BNs models to CF tasks instead of simple ones, and work on real-world multi-class CF data instead of synthetic binary-class data. Empirical results show that with their ability to deal with incomplete data, the extended logistic regression on tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN-ELR) 3 CF model consistently performs better than the traditional Pearson correlation-based CF algorithm for the rating data that have few items or high missing rates. In addition, the ELR-optimized BNs CF models are robust in terms of the ability to make predictions, while the robustness of the Pearson correlation-based CF algorithm degrades as the sparseness of the data increases.}},

Memory-based algorithms recommend according to the preferences of nearest neighbors, and model-based algorithms recornmend by first developing a model of user ratings. In this paper, we bring to surface factors that affect CF process in order to identify existing false beliefs. In terms of accuracy, by being able to view the ``big picture{''}, we propose new approaches that substantially improve the performance of CF algorithms. For instance, we obtain more than 40\% increase in precision in comparison to widely-used CF algorithms. In terms of efficiency, we propose a model-based approach based on latent semantic indexing (LSI), that reduces execution times at least 50\% than the classic CF algorithms. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract                   = {{With broadcast Television (TV) going digital, the number of channels and the programs aired have increased tremendously. Millions of audiences of various categories such as adults, children, youth and families watch these programs. Advertisements (ads) aired during these programs are targeted to reach these varied audiences and are the main revenue earners for TV broadcasters. While TV broadcasters have the task of scheduling hundreds of ads during the various ad breaks of programs, it is important that the ads shown during any ad break have a good impact on the viewers. An intelligent ad recommendation system that takes into account various factors such as ad/program content, viewers' interests, sponsors' preferences, program timing, program popularity and the available ad slot that help increasing the ad revenue would be useful for sponsors and broadcasters. We present in this paper a single end-to-end ad recommender system that considers all of these factors and recommends a set of well scheduled and sequenced ads that are the best suited for a given TV ad break. The proposed recommendation system captures the features of the ad video in terms of annotations derived from MPEG-7 descriptions and these annotation keywords are systematically grouped into a number of pre-defined semantic categories by using a categorization technique. A fuzzy categorical data clustering technique is then applied on the categorized data for grouping the best suited ads for a set of pre-defined program classes such as News, Sports, Cartoons etc. The program classes considered are selected to match with the TV program genres proposed in the TV-anytime standard. Since the same ad can be recommended to more than one program depending upon multiple parameters, fuzzy clustering acts as a well suited (and perhaps also the best suited) technique for ad recommendation. The relative fuzzy score called ``degree of membership{''} calculated for each ad is an indicator of the number of program clusters to which the given ad belongs to. The clustered ads are then scheduled using an algorithm that takes into consideration parameters such as program popularity, program timing and available ad slots, to provide the best possible package for sponsors to show their ads. The scheduled set of ads if played randomly during an ad break might make viewers (sponsors) unhappy, for instance, when similar (competing) product ads get played consecutively. Hence, the system employs sequencing algorithm that takes into account the pre- and post-ad sequences in order to better order the scheduled set of ads in any ad break. We show that our proposed recommendation system provides an effective way of recommending the right ads for broadcast TV programs. We also demonstrate that this strategy does indeed help sponsors to attract viewers' attention while playing their ads during ad breaks of TV programs. The proposed ad recommendation system is compared and evaluated subjectively with the current ad display system, by ten different people, and is rated with a high success score.}},

We consider example-critiquing, a methodology based on showing examples to the user and acquiring preferences in the form of critiques. In our approach critiques are volunteered in a mixed-initiative interaction. Some recommendations are suggestions specifically aimed at stimulating preference expression to acquire an accurate preference model. We propose a method to adapt the suggestions according to observations of the user's behavior. We evaluate the decision accuracy of our approach with both simulations exploiting logs of previous users of the system (in order to see how adaptive suggestions improve the process of preference elicitation) and surveys with real users where we compare our approach of example critiquing with an interface based on question-answering.}},

    abstract                   = {{Collaborative filtering aims at predicting a user's interest for a given item based on a collection of user profiles. This article views collaborative filtering as a problem highly related to information retrieval, drawing an analogy between the concepts of users and items in recommender systems and queries and documents in text retrieval. We present a probabilistic user-to-item relevance framework that introduces the concept of relevance into the related problem of collaborative filtering. Three different models are derived, namely, a user-based, an item-based, and a unified relevance model, and we estimate their rating predictions from three sources: the user's own ratings for different items, other users' ratings for the same item, and ratings from different but similar users for other but similar items. To reduce the data sparsity encountered when estimating the probability density function of the relevance variable, we apply the nonparametric (data-driven) density estimation technique known as the Parzen-window method (or kernel-based density estimation). Using a Gaussian window function, the similarity between users and/or items would, however, be based on Euclidean distance. Because the collaborative filtering literature has reported improved prediction accuracy when using cosine similarity, we generalize the Parzen-window method by introducing a projection kernel. Existing user-based and item-based approaches correspond to two simplified instantiations of our framework. User-based and item-based collaborative filterings represent only a partial view of the prediction problem, where the unified relevance model brings these partial views together under the same umbrella. Experimental results complement the theoretical insights with improved recommendation accuracy. The unified model is more robust to data sparsity because the different types of ratings are used in concert.}},

    abstract                   = {{Collaborative filtering is concerned with making recommendations about items to users. Most formulations of the problem are specifically designed for predicting user ratings, assuming past data of explicit user ratings is available. However, in practice we may only have implicit evidence of user preference; and furthermore, a better view of the task is of generating a top-N list of items that the user is most likely to like. In this regard, we argue that collaborative filtering can be directly cast as a relevance ranking problem. We begin with the classic Probability Ranking Principle of information retrieval, proposing a probabilistic item ranking framework. In the framework, we derive two different ranking models, showing that despite their common origin, different factorizations reflect two distinctive ways to approach item ranking. For the model estimations, we limit our discussions to implicit user preference data, and adopt an approximation method introduced in the classic text retrieval model (i.e. the Okapi BM25 formula) to effectively decouple frequency counts and presence/absence counts in the preference data. Furthermore, we extend the basic formula by proposing the Bayesian inference to estimate the probability of relevance (and non-relevance), which largely alleviates the data sparsity problem. Apart from a theoretical contribution, our experiments on real data sets demonstrate that the proposed methods perform significantly better than other strong baselines.}},

These systems have used a number of different approaches, since no one technique is best for all users in all situations. Given this, we believe that to be effective, systems should incorporate a wide variety of such techniques and then some form of overarching framework should be put in place to coordinate them so that only the best recommendations (from whatever source) are presented to the user. To this end, in our previous work, we detailed a market-based approach in which various recommender agents competed with one another to present their recommendations to the user. We showed through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation with simulated users that an appropriately designed marketplace should be able to provide effective coordination. Building on this, we now report on the development of this multi-agent system and its evaluation with real users. Specifically, we show that our system is capable of consistently giving high quality recommendations, that the best recommendations that could be put forward are actually put forward, and that the combination of recommenders performs better than any constituent recommender.}},

    abstract                   = {{Personalization is considered a powerful methodology for improving the effectiveness of information search and decision making. It has led to the dissemination of systems capable of suggesting relevant and personalized information (or items) to the users, according to their characteristics and preferences, as represented by a User Model (UM). Since the quality of the personalization largely depends on the size and accuracy of the managed UMs, it would be beneficial to enrich the UMs by mediating, i.e., importing and integrating, UMs built by other personalization systems. This work discusses and evaluates a cross-representation mediation of UMs from collaborative filtering to content-based recommender systems. According to this approach, a content-based recommender system, having partial or no UM data, can generate recommendations for users by mediating UM data of the same users, collected by a collaborative filtering system. The mediation process transforms the UMs from the collaborative filtering ratings to the content-based weighted item features. The mediation process exploits the item descriptions that are typically not used by the collaborative filtering recommender systems. An experimental evaluation conducted in the domain of movies shows that for users with small collaborative filtering UMs, i.e., users with few item ratings, the accuracy of the recommendations provided using the mediated content-based UMs is superior to that using the original collaborative filtering UMs. Moreover, it shows that the mediation can be used to improve a content-based recommender system by incrementally mediating collaborative filtering UM data (item ratings) and enriching the available content-based UMs.}},

In real life, we come to know about others through our social circle according to their reputation which is a public view. However, it is not always adequate to depend solely on the public view and therefore a trust measure is required to give a personalized view of the future encounters with a specific partner. In this paper, we propose fuzzy computational models for both trust and reputation concepts. Reciprocity and experience are used for trust modeling while the proposed reputation model is a fuzzy extension of beta reputation model. A two-level filtering methodology is proposed to benefit to a large extent from both the concepts separately. In order to justify the proposed models, we compared them with the existing reputation models for movie RS. The experimental results show that the incorporation of trust and reputation concepts into RS indeed improves the recommendation accuracy and establish that our models are better than beta and the popular eBay reputation models.

The proposed platform uses stereotypes to initialize user models, adapts user profiles dynamically and clusters users into similar interest groups. A science fiction museum has been set up as a case study for this platform and an evaluation has been carried out.}},

Many research papers are improved by pointing out either Multiple Criteria Rating approach or Multidimensional approach for Recommender System. This paper proposes an advanced Recommender System to provide higher quality of recommendations by combining the Multiple Criteria rating and the Multidimensional approaches. For the Multiple Criteria approach, this paper proposed a method that changes the way of weighting to be more suitable and also concern about the frequency of the selection movie features. To do Multidimensional approach, the Multiple Linear Regression is applied to analyze the contextual information of user characteristics. According to the experimental evaluation, the combining of Multiple Criteria Rating and Multidimensional approaches provide more accurate recommendation results than the current Hybrid Recommender Systems.}},

The aim of this paper is to automatically recommend a ranked list of new items to a group of users. We will investigate the value of using Bayesian networks to represent the different uncertainties involved in a group recommending process, i.e. those uncertainties related to mechanisms that govern the interactions between group members and the processes leading to the final choice or recommendation. We will also show how the most common aggregation strategies might be encoded using a Bayesian network formalism. The proposed model can be considered as a collaborative Bayesian network-based group recommender system, where group ratings are computed from the past voting patterns of other users with similar tastes.}},

The useful information discovered can be used directly by the teacher or author of the course in order to improve instructional/learning performance. This can, however, imply a lot of work for the teacher who can greatly benefit from the help of educational recommender systems for doing this task. In this paper we propose a system oriented to find, share and suggest the most appropriate modifications to improve the effectiveness of the course. We describe an iterative methodology to develop and carry out the maintenance of web-based courses to which we have added a specific data mining step. We apply association rule mining to discover interesting information through students' usage data in the form of IF-THEN recommendation rules. We have also used a collaborative recommender system to share and score the recommendation rules obtained by teachers with similar profiles along with other experts in education. Finally, we have carried out experiments with several real groups of students using a web-based adaptive course. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed architecture constitutes a good starting point to future investigations in order to generalize the results over many course contents.}},

For those systems to be effective, however, it is important to understand the relationship between social and personal preferences. In this work we investigate features of profile similarity and how those relate to the way users determine trust. Through a controlled study, we isolate several profile features beyond overall similarity that affect how much subjects trust hypothetical users. We then use data from FilmTrust, a real social network where users rate movies, and show that the profile features discovered in the experiment allow us to more accurately predict trust than when using only overall similarity. In this article, we present these experimental results and discuss the potential implications for using trust in user interfaces.}},

These algorithms typically perform differently in various domains and tasks. Therefore, it is important from the research perspective, as well as from a practical view, to be able to decide on an algorithm that matches the domain and the task of interest. The standard way to make such decisions is by comparing a number of algorithms offline using some evaluation metric. Indeed, many evaluation metrics have been suggested for comparing recommendation algorithms. The decision on the proper evaluation metric is often critical, as each metric may favor a different algorithm. In this paper we review the proper construction of offline experiments for deciding on the most appropriate algorithm. We discuss three important tasks of recommender systems, and classify a set of appropriate well known evaluation metrics for each task. We demonstrate how using an improper evaluation metric can lead to the selection of an improper algorithm for the task of interest. We also discuss other important considerations when designing offline experiments.}},

We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendation lists as a dynamic link generation and it is feasible to apply the XML Link Language (XLink) for a novel recommendation solution. However, XLink lacks knowledge and semantic representation to cope with the computer-interpretable effects. In this paper, we address the issue developing an Semantic XLink Recommendation System (SXRS), which is based on semantic web technologies and is composed of XLink base, knowledge base, Search Engine, and Inference Engine to provide three different approaches to represent the linking knowledge - XLink-based metadata, ontology-based reasoning, and rule-based inference. To illustrate the SXRS applications, we implemented an academic domain recommender system that offers dynamic recommendation lists to assist student to plan semester courses. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A new two-stage recommendation process is developed to predict customer purchase behavior for the product categories, as well as for product items. The time window weight is introduced to produce sequential patterns closer to the current time period that possess a larger impact on the prediction than patterns relatively far from the current time period. This study is the first to propose time-decaying sequential patterns within a collaborative recommender system. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms the traditional collaborative system using a public food mart dataset and a synthetic dataset. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, new techniques for the fast computation of ``user-optimal{''} query relaxations are proposed. We show how the number of costly catalog queries can be minimized with the help of a query pre-processing approach, how we can compute relaxations that contain at least n items in the recommendation, and finally, how a recent conflict-detection algorithm can be applied for fast determination of preferred conflicts in interactive recovery scenarios.}},

These systems are widely used in electronic commerce to help customers find products according to their preferences. Taking into account the customer's ratings of some products available in the system, the recommender system tries to predict the ratings the customer would give to other products in the system. The proposed factorization-based approach uses all the information provided to compute the predicted ratings, in the same way as approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The main advantage of this technique versus SVD-based approaches is that it can deal with missing data. It also has a smaller computational cost. Experimental results with public data sets are provided to show that the proposed adapted factorization approach gives better predicted ratings than a widely used SVD-based approach.}},

Our approach is based on the idea that there are communities of users that find the same characteristics important to like or dislike a product. This model is an extension of the probabilistic latent semantic model for collaborative filtering with ideas based on clusterwise linear regression.

In contrast to automatic technology-generated recommender systems, this paper aims to use dynamic expert groups that are automatically formed to recommend domain-specific documents for general users. In addition, it aims to test several effectiveness measures of rank order to determine if the top-ranked lists recommended by the experts were reliable. Design/methodology/approach - In the approach, expert groups evaluate web documents to provide a recommender system for general users. The authority and make-up of the expert group are adjusted through user feedback. The system also uses various measures to gauge the difference between the opinions of experts and those of general users to improve the evaluation effectiveness. Findings - The proposed system is efficient when there is major support from experts and general users. The recommender system is especially effective where there is a limited amount of evaluation data from general users. Originality/value - This is an original study of how to effectively recommend web documents to users based on the opinions of human experts.

    abstract                   = {{The two of the most famous techniques in collaborative filtering (CF) are the so-called User-Based CF and Item-Based CF. in this paper, we claim that each of them takes only one-directional information from the user-item ratings matrix to generate recommendations. In other words the former combines user similarities and the latter tries to make a prediction by utilizing item similarities. We can observe the same appearance in the other CF area using binary user-item matrix in which transactions, i.e. purchase (1) or non-purchase (0), are marked. It means that we may use only half of the total information from the given data set. Completing the missing part of usable information we proposed a new prediction method, two-way cooperative CF which takes both vertical and horizontal information, in the ensemble respect. The proposed prediction scheme does not fix its CF technique but associates two predictions, which come from different CF algorithms, by weighted averaging. To decide fair weights the four cases, equivalent case, user-winning case, item-winning case, and prediction-impossible case are categorized by measuring the amount of information which each CF utilizes, or the degree of the reliability of a prediction model. We also embedded bagging in our prediction frame to make more accurate predictions. Numerical experiments showed that the proposed method outperformed in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness to data sparseness based on both ratings and binary user-item matrix.

More and more online users arc relying oil this type of services such as news, articles, bookmarks, and various user-generated contents around World Wide Web. However, the quality and the veracity of peers' contributions are not well managed. Without a practical means to assess the quality of peer production services, the consequence is information-overloading. In this study, we present a recommender system based oil the trust of social networks. Through the trust computing, the quality and the veracity of peer production services can be appropriately assessed. Two prominent fuzzy logic applications fuzzy inference system and fuzzy MCDM method are utilized to support the decision of service choice. The experimental results showed that the proposed recommender system can significantly enhance the quality of peer production services and furthermore overcome the information overload problems. In addition, a trust-based social news system is built to demonstrate the application of the proposed system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

    abstract                   = {{Purpose - As library collections increase rapidly, personalized recommender systems have become a very important service for library patrons. The purpose of this paper is to design and implement a personal ontology recommender (PORE) system by building personal ontologies based on patrons' borrowing records. Design/methodology/approach - In the PORE system, the traditional cataloging scheme, classification for Chinese libraries, is used as the reference ontology. This reference ontology is transformed to a unique personal ontology for each user based on the mining results from library borrowing records of that user. Findings - A personal ontology represents a unique user interest on specific subjects. The personal ontology can be used to filter out unsuitable recommendations based only on a keyword matching method. Besides, the recommended books can be organized into the personal ontology, and provide the patron with a user-friendly interface to access library collections. Research limitations/implications - The PORE system is currently implemented for Chinese collections. From this paper builds a new version to support English collections by adopting the Library of Congress Classification as the reference ontology. Originality/value - This paper represents a practical method of building a user's personal ontology and explains the functional use of ontology knowledge.}},

By using the opinion spreading process, the similarity between any users can be obtained. The algorithm has remarkably higher accuracy than the standard collaborative filtering using the Pearson correlation. Furthermore, we introduce a free parameter beta to regulate the contributions of objects to user-user correlations. The numerical results indicate that decreasing the influence of popular objects can further improve the algorithmic accuracy and personality. We argue that a better algorithm should simultaneously require less computation and generate higher accuracy. Accordingly, we further propose an algorithm involving only the top-N similar neighbors for each target user, which has both less computational complexity higher algorithmic accuracy.}},

In this paper, we present a local path index to estimate the likelihood of the existence of a link between two nodes. We propose a network model with controllable density and noise strength in generating links, as well as collect data of six real networks. Extensive numerical simulations on both modeled networks and real networks demonstrated the high effectiveness and efficiency of the local path index compared with two well-known and widely used indices: the common neighbors and the Katz index. Indeed, the local path index provides competitively accurate predictions as the Katz index while requires much less CPU time and memory space than the Katz index, which is therefore a strong candidate for potential practical applications in data mining of huge-size networks.}},

    abstract                   = {{Recommender systems for e-learning demand specific pedagogy-oriented and hybrid recommendation strategies. Current systems are often based on time-consuming, top down information provisioning combined with intensive data-mining collaborative filtering approaches. However, such systems do not seem appropriate for Learning Networks where distributed information can often not be identified beforehand. Providing sound way-finding support for lifelong learners in Learning Networks requires dedicated personalised recommender systems (PRS), that offer the learners customised advise on which learning actions or programs to study next. Such systems should also be practically feasible and be developed with minimized effort. Currently, such so called light-weight PRS systems are scarcely available. This study shows that simulation studies can support the analysis and optimisation of PRS requirements prior to starting the costly process of their development, and practical implementation (including testing and revision) during field experiments in real-life learning situations. This simulation study confirms that providing recommendations leads towards more effective, more satisfied, and faster goal achievement. Furthermore, this study reveals that a light-weight hybrid PRS-system based on ratings is a good alternative for an ontology-based system, in particular for low-level goal achievement. Finally, it is found that rating-based light-weight hybrid PRS-systems enable more effective, more satisfied, and faster goal attainment than peer-based light-weight hybrid PRS-systems (incorporating collaborative techniques without rating).}},

It causes the information access by the users is a complex activity and they need tools to assist them to obtain the required information. Recommender systems are tools whose objective is to evaluate and filter the great amount of information available in a specific scope to assist the users in their information access processes. Another obstacle is the great variety of representations of information, specially when the users take part in the process, so we need more flexibility in the information processing. The fuzzy linguistic modeling allows to represent and handle flexible information. Similar problems are appearing in other frameworks, such as digital academic libraries, research offices, business contacts, etc. We focus on information access processes in technology transfer offices. The aim of this paper is to develop a recommender system for research resources based on fuzzy linguistic modeling. The system helps researchers and environment companies allowing them to obtain automatically information about research resources (calls or projects) in their interest areas. it is designed using some filtering tools and a particular fuzzy linguistic modeling, called multi-granular fuzzy linguistic modeling, which is useful when we have to assess different qualitative concepts. The system is working in the University of Granada and experimental results show that it is feasible and effective. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

    abstract                   = {{Web recommender systems are Web applications capable of generating useful suggestions for visitors of Internet sites. However, in the case of large user communities and in presence of a high number of Web sites, these tasks are computationally onerous, even more if the client software runs on devices with limited resources. Moreover, the quality of the recommendations strictly depends on how the recommendation algorithm takes into account the currently used device. Some approaches proposed in the literature provide multidimensional recommendations considering, besides items and users, also the exploited device. However, these systems do not efficiently perform, since they assign to either the client or the server the arduous cost of computing recommendations. In this article, we argue that a fully distributed organization is a suitable solution to improve the efficiency of multidimensional recommender systems. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel distributed architecture, called MUADDIB, where each user's device is provided with a device assistant that autonomously retrieves information about the user's behavior. Moreover, a single profiler, associated with the user, periodically collects information coming from the different user's device assistants to construct a global user's profile. In order to generate recommendations, a recommender precomputes data provided by the profilers. This way, the site manager has only the task of suitably presenting the content of the site, while the computation of the recommendations is assigned to the other distributed components. Some experiments conducted on real data and using some well-known metrics show that the system works more effectively and efficiently than other device-based distributed recommenders.}},

Accordingly, we design a modified collaborative filtering algorithm, which provides remarkably higher accurate predictions than the standard collaborative filtering. More interestingly, we find that the algorithmic performance will approach its optimal value when the parameter, contained in the definition of transferring similarity, gets close to its critical value, before which the series expansion of transferring similarity is convergent and after which it is divergent. Our study is complementary to the one reported in {[}E. A. Leicht, P. Holme, and M. E. J. Newman, Phys. Rev. E 73, 026120 (2006)], and is relevant to the missing link prediction problem.}},

Since trust is often a gradual phenomenon, fuzzy relations are the pre-eminent tools for modeling such networks. However, as current trust-enhanced RSs do not work with the notion of distrust, they cannot differentiate unknown users from malicious users, nor represent inconsistency. These are serious drawbacks in large networks where many users are unknown to each other and might provide contradictory information. In this paper, we advocate the use of a trust model in which trust scores are (trust,distrust)couples, drawn from a bilattice that preserves valuable trust provenance information including gradual trust, distrust, ignorance, and inconsistency. We pay particular attention to deriving trust information through a trusted third party, which becomes especially challenging when also distrust is involved. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

They typically exploit explicit or implicit user feedback such as ratings, buying records or clickstream data and apply statistical methods to derive recommendations. This paper focuses on explicitly formulated customer requirements as the sole type of user feedback. Its contribution lies in comparing different techniques such as knowledge- and utility-based methods, collaborative filtering, association rule mining as well as hybrid variants when user models consist solely of explicit customer requirements. We examine how this type of user feedback can be exploited for personalization in e-commerce scenarios. Furthermore, examples of actual online shops are developed where such contextual user information is available, demonstrating how more efficient RS configurations can be implemented. Results indicate that, especially for new users, explicit customer requirements are a useful source of feedback for personalization and hybrid configurations of collaborative and knowledge-based techniques achieve best results.}},

This is because item features and user feedback are subjective, imprecise and vague. The paper presents a fuzzy set theoretic method (FTM) for recommender systems that handles the non-stochastic uncertainty induced from subjectivity, vagueness and imprecision in the data, and the domain knowledge and the task under consideration. The research further advances the application of fuzzy modeling for content-based recommender systems initially presented by Ronald Yager. The paper defines a representation method, similarity measures and aggregation methods as well as empirically evaluates the methods' performance through simulation using a benchmark movie data. FTM consist of a representation method for items' features and user feedback using fuzzy sets. and a content-based algorithm based on various fuzzy set theoretic similarity measures (the fuzzy set extensions of the Jaccard index, cosine, proximity or correlation similarity measures), and aggregation methods for computing recommendation confidence scores (the maximum-minimum or Weighted-sum fuzzy set theoretic aggregation methods). Compared to the baseline crisp set based method (CSM) presented, the empirical evaluation of the FTM using the movie data and simulation shows an improvement in precision without loss of recall. Moreover, the paper provides a guideline for recommender systems designers that will help in choosing from a combination of one of the fuzzy set theoretic aggregation methods and similarity measures.

Our random walk approach directly generates the top-N recommendations for individuals, rather than predicting the ratings of the recommendations.

    abstract                   = {{Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most widely used methods for personalized product recommendation at online stores. CIF predicts users' preferences on products using past data of users such as purchase records or their ratings on products. The prediction is then used for personalized recommendation so that products with highly estimated preference for each user are selected and presented. One of the most difficult issues in using CF is that it is often hard to collect sufficient amount of data for each user to estimate preferences accurately enough. In order to address this problem, this research studies how we can gain the most information about each user by collecting data on a very small number of selected products, and develops a method for choosing a sequence of such products tailored to each user based on metrics from information theory and correlation-based product similarity. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is tested using experiments with the MovieLens dataset. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

In this paper, we propose an intelligent browsing system based on a novel recommendation paradigm. Our approach combines usage patters with low-level features and semantic descriptors in order to predict users' behavior and provide effective recommendations. The proposed paradigm is very general and can be applied to any type of multimedia data. In order to make the recommender system even more flexible, we introduce the concept of multichannel browser, i.e. a browser that allows concurrent browsing of multiple media channels. We implemented a prototype of the proposed system and tested the effectiveness of our approach in a virtual museum scenario. Experimental results have proved that the system greatly enhances users' experience, thus encouraging further research in this direction.}},

To date, results show that incorporating social relationship data - beyond consumption profile similarity - is beneficial only in a very limited set of cases. The main conjecture of this study is that the inconclusive results are, at least to some extent, due to an under-specification of the nature of the social relations. To date, there exist no clear guidelines for using behavioral theory to guide systems design. Our primary objective is to propose a methodology for theory-driven design. We enhance Walls et al.'s (1992) IS Design Theory by introducing the notion of ``applied behavioral theory,{''} as a means of better linking theory and system design. Our second objective is to apply our theory-driven design methodology to social recommender systems, with the aim of improving prediction accuracy. A behavioral study found that some social relationships (e.g., competence, benevolence) are most likely to affect a recipient's advice-taking decision. We designed, developed, and tested a recommender system based on these principles, and found that the same types of relationships yield the best recommendation accuracy. This striking correspondence highlights the importance of behavioral theory in guiding system design. We discuss implications for design science and for research on recommender systems.}},

    abstract                   = {{e-Commerce recommender systems select potentially interesting products for users by looking at their purchase histories and preferences. In order to compare the available products against those included in the user's profile, semantics-based recommendation strategies consider metadata annotations that describe their main attributes. Besides, to ensure successful suggestions of products, these strategies adapt the recommendations as the user's preferences evolve over time. Traditional approaches face two limitations related to the aforementioned features. First, product providers are not typically willing to take on the tedious task of annotating accurately a huge diversity of commercial items, thus leading to a substantial impoverishment of the personalization quality. Second, the adaptation process of the recommendations misses the time elapsed since the user has bought an item, which is an essential parameter that affects differently to each purchased product. This results in some pointless recommendations, e.g. including regularly items that the users are only willing to buy sporadically. In order to fight both limitations, we propose a personalized e-commerce system with two main features. On the one hand, we incentivize the users to provide high-quality metadata for commercial products; on the other, we explore a strategy that offers time-aware recommendations by combining semantic reasoning about these annotations with item-specific time functions. The synergetic effects derived from this combination lead to suggestions adapted to the particular needs of the users at any time. This approach has been experimentally validated with a set of users who accessed Our personalized e-commerce system through a range of fixed and handheld Consumer devices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The operating core of recommender systems is based on the collaborative filtering stage, which, in current user to user recommender processes, usually uses the Pearson correlation metric. In this paper, we present a new metric which combines the numerical information of the votes with independent information from those values, based on the proportions of the common and uncommon votes between each pair of users. Likewise, we define the reasoning and experiments on which the design of the metric is based and the restriction of being applied to recommender systems where the possible range of votes is not greater than 5. In order to demonstrate the superior nature of the proposed metric, we provide the comparative results of a set of experiments based on the MovieLens, FilmAffinity and NetFlix databases. In addition to the traditional levels of accuracy, results are also provided on the metrics' coverage, the percentage of hits obtained and the precision/recall (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved}},

    abstract                   = {{Recommendation systems that provide appropriate solutions to users to reduce their decision complexity have become popular in the Internet world. Designing and evaluating such systems remain essential challenges to researchers and practitioners. Toward that end, a critical task is how to obtain user preferences. Mobile phones have become indispensable in everyday life, yet fierce market competition, characterized by rapid introductions of different models with novel designs and advanced features, have made consumers' purchase decision making increasingly complex. As a well-established, multiple criteria decision technique, analytic hierarchy processing (AHP) provides an intuitive model of a hierarchical structure capable of supporting complex product comparisons and evaluations by consumers. In this paper, we illustrate the application of an AHP-based mechanism to develop a Web-based recommendation system and empirically evaluate the prototype by conducting a controlled experiment with 244 mobile phone users, focusing on both content and system satisfaction. Our evaluation includes benchmark systems built on rank-based analysis and an equal weight-based system as comparative baselines. Overall, the results suggest the viability and value of using AHP to construct effective recommendation systems. Subjects appear satisfied with the recommendations by the AHP-based system, though its relatively demanding input requirements may need mitigation and adequate interface designs. This study contributes to research and practice in recommender systems in general and helps develop mobile phone recommendation systems for online stores and consumers in particular.

Therefore, more effort has been made in recent years to develop recommender systems that recommend products or services to users so as to assist in their decision-making process. In this article, we describe crucial experimental results about a novel recommender technology, called the preference-based organization (Pref-ORG), which generates critique suggestions in addition to recommendations according to users' preferences. The critique is a form of feedback ({''}I would like something cheaper than this one{''}) that users can provide to the currently displayed product, with which the system may better predict what the user truly wants. We compare the preference-based organization technique with related approaches, including the ones that also produce critique candidates, but without the consideration of user preferences. A simulation setup is first presented, that identified Pref-ORG's significantly higher algorithm accuracy in predicting critiques and choices that users should intend to make, followed by a real-user evaluation which practically verified its significant impact on saving users' decision effort.}},

The main problem with these systems lies in those items for which we have little information and which cause incorrect predictions. One accredited solution involves using the items' content information to improve these recommendations, but this cannot be applied in situations where the content information is unavailable. In this paper we present a novel idea to deal with this problem, using only the available users' ratings. The objective is to use all possible information in the dataset to improve recommendations made with little information. For this purpose we will use what we call second-hand information: in the recommendation process, when a similar user has not rated the target item, we will guess his/her preferences using the information available. This idea is independent from the RS used and, in order to test it, we will employ two different collaborative RS. The results obtained confirm the soundness of our proposal.}},

An unprecedented volume of supply is now on offer, whetted by the demand of millions of users from all over the world. Since users cannot be expected to browse through millions of different items to find what they might like, filtering has become a popular technique to connect supply and demand: trusted users are first identified, and their opinions are then used to create recommendations. In this domain, users' trustworthiness has been measured according to one of the following two criteria: taste similarity (i.e., ``I trust those who agree with me{''}), or social ties (i.e., ``I trust my friends, and the people that my friends trust{''}). The former criterion aims at identifying concordant users, but is subject to abuse by malicious behaviors. The latter aims at detecting well-intentioned users, but fails to capture the natural subjectivity of tastes. In this article, we propose a new definition of trusted recommenders, addressing those users that are both well-intentioned and concordant. Based on this characterisation, we propose a novel approach to information filtering that we call dependable filtering. We describe alternative algorithms realizing this approach, and demonstrate, by means of extensive performance evaluation on a variety of real large-scale datasets, the high degree of both accuracy and robustness they entail.}},

Recommender systems aim at directing users through this information space, toward the resources that best meet their needs and interests by extracting knowledge from the previous users' interactions. In this paper. we propose three algorithms to solve the web page recommendation problem. In our first algorithm, we use distributed learning automata to learn the behavior of previous users' and recommend pages to the current user based on learned patterns. By introducing a novel weighted association rule mining algorithm, we present our second algorithm for recommendation purpose. Also, a novel method is proposed to pure the current session window. One of the challenging problems in recommendation systems is dealing with unvisited or newly added pages. By considering this problem and improving the efficiency of first two algorithms we present a hybrid algorithm based on distributed learning automata and proposed weighted association rule mining algorithm In the hybrid algorithm we employ the HITS algorithm to extend the recommendation set. Our experiments on real data set show that the hybrid algorithm performs better than the other algorithms we compared to and, at the same time, it is less complex than other proposed algorithms with respect to memory usage and computational cost too.

    abstract                   = {{This work introduces a probabilistic model allowing to compute reputation scores as close as possible to their intrinsic value, according to the model. It is based on the following, natural, consumer-provider interaction model. Consumers are assumed to order items from providers, who each has some intrinsic, latent, ``quality of service{''} score. In the basic model, the providers supply the items with a quality following a normal law, centered on their intrinsic ``quality of service{''}. The consumers, after the reception and the inspection of the item, rate it according to a linear function of its quality - a standard regression model. This regression model accounts for the bias of the consumer in providing ratings as well as his reactivity towards changes in item quality. Moreover, the constancy of the provider in supplying an equal quality level when delivering the items is estimated by the standard deviation of his normal law of item quality generation. Symmetrically, the consistency of the consumer in providing similar ratings for a given quality is quantified by the standard deviation of his normal law of ratings generation. Two extensions of this basic model are considered as well: a model accounting for truncation of the ratings and a Bayesian model assuming a prior distribution on the parameters. Expectation-maximization algorithms, allowing to estimate the parameters based on the ratings, are developed for all the models. The experiments suggest that these models are able to extract useful information from the ratings, are robust towards adverse behaviors such as cheating, and are competitive in comparison with standard methods. Even if the suggested models do not show considerable improvements over other competing models (such as Brockhoff and Skovgaard's model {[}12]), they, however, also permit to estimate interesting features over the raters such as their reactivity, bias, consistency, reliability, or expectation.

Web recommender systems help users make decisions in this complex information space where the volume of information available to them is huge. Recently, a number of Web page recommender systems have been developed to extract the user behavior from the user's navigational path and predict the next request as s/he visits Web pages. However, each of these systems has its own merits and limitations. In this paper, we investigate a hybrid recommender system, which combines the results of several recommender techniques based on Web usage mining. We conduct a detailed comparative evaluation of how different combined methods and different recommendation techniques affect the prediction accuracy of the hybrid recommender. We then discuss the results in terms of using a hybrid recommender system instead of a single recommender model. Our results suggest that the hybrid recommender system is better in predicting the next request of a Web user. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Most existing recommendation techniques typically rely on users' historical, long-term interest profiles, derived either explicitly from users' preference ratings or implicitly from their purchasing/browsing history, to arrive at recommendation decisions. In this study, we propose a coauthorship network-based, task-focused literature recommendation technique to meet users' information need specific to a task under investigation and develop three different schemes for estimating the closeness between scholars based on their coauthoring relationships. We empirically evaluate the proposed coauthorship network-based technique. The evaluation results suggest that our proposed technique outperforms the author-based technique across various degrees of content coherence in task profiles. The proposed technique is more effective than the content-based technique when task profiles specified by users are similar in their contents but is less effective otherwise. We further develop a hybrid method that switches between the coauthorship network-based and content-based techniques on the basis of the content coherence of a task profile. It achieves comparable or better recommendation effectiveness, when compared with the pure coauthorship network-based and content-based techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

The idea underlying this approach is that the interests of an active user will more likely coincide with those of users who share similar preferences to the active user. Hence, the choice and computation of a similarity measure between users is critical to rating items. This work proposes a similarity update method that uses an iterative message passing procedure. Additionally, this work deals with a drawback of using the popular mean absolute error (MAE) for performance evaluation, namely that ignores ratings distribution. A novel modulation method and an accuracy metric are presented in order to minimize the predictive accuracy error and to evenly distribute predicted ratings over true rating scales. Preliminary results show that the proposed similarity update and prediction modulation techniques significantly improve the predicted rankings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

    abstract                   = {{Customer preferences for products are drifting over time. Product perception and popularity are constantly changing as new selection emerges. Similarly, customer inclinations are evolving, leading them to ever redefine their taste. Thus, modeling temporal dynamics is essential for designing recommender systems or general customer preference models. However, this raises unique challenges. Within the ecosystem intersecting multiple products and customers, many different characteristics are shifting simultaneously, while many of them influence each other and often those shifts are delicate and associated with a few data instances. This distinguishes the problem from concept drift explorations, where mostly a single concept is tracked. Classical time-window or instance decay approaches cannot work, as they lose too many signals when discarding data instances. A more sensitive approach is required, which can make better distinctions between transient effects and long-term patterns. We show how to model the time changing behavior throughout the life span of the data. Such a model allows us to exploit the relevant components of all data instances, while discarding only what is modeled as being irrelevant. Accordingly, we revamp two leading collaborative filtering recommendation approaches. Evaluation is made on a large movie-rating dataset underlying the Netflix Prize contest. Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on this dataset. In particular, methods described in this paper play a significant role in the solution that won the Netflix contest.}},

    abstract                   = {{Collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommender systems represent a promising solution for the rapidly growing mobile music market. However, in the mobile Web environment, a traditional CF system that uses explicit ratings to collect user preferences has a limitation: mobile customers find it difficult to rate their tastes directly because of poor interfaces and high telecommunication costs. Implicit ratings are more desirable for the mobile Web, but commonly used cardinal (interval, ratio) scales for representing preferences are also unsatisfactory because they may increase estimation errors. In this paper, we propose a CF-based recommendation methodology based on both implicit ratings and less ambitious ordinal scales. A mobile Web usage mining (mWUM) technique is suggested as an implicit rating approach, and a specific consensus model typically used in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is employed to generate an ordinal scale-based customer profile. An experiment with the participation of real mobile Web customers shows that the proposed methodology provides better performance than existing CF algorithms in the mobile Web environment.

In the MCF, instead of the cosine similarity index, the user-user correlations are obtained by a diffusion process. Furthermore, by considering the second-order correlations, we design an effective algorithm that depresses the influence of mainstream preferences. Simulation results show that the algorithmic accuracy, measured by the average ranking score, is further improved by 20.45\% and 33.25\% in the optimal cases of MovieLens and Netflix data. More importantly. the optimal value; lambda(opt) depends approximately monotonously on the sparsity of the training set. Given a real system, we could estimate the optimal parameter according to the data sparsity, which makes this algorithm easy to be applied. In addition, two significant criteria of algorithmic performance, diversity and popularity, are also taken into account. Numerical results show that as the sparsity increases, the algorithm considering the second-order correlation can outperform the MCF simultaneously in all three criteria. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although collaborative filtering (CF), the most popular recommendation technique, utilizes similar neighbors to generate recommendations, it does not distinguish friends in a neighborhood from strangers who have similar tastes. Because social networking Web sites now make it easy to gather social network information, a study about the use of social network information in making recommendations will probably produce productive results. In this study, we developed a way to increase recommendation effectiveness by incorporating social network information into CF. We collected data about users' preference ratings and their social network relationships from a social networking Web site. Then, we evaluated CF performance with diverse neighbor groups combining groups of friends and nearest neighbors. Our results indicated that more accurate prediction algorithms can be produced by incorporating social network information into CF. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

    abstract                   = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a new ontological content-based filtering method for ranking the relevance of items for readers of news items, and its evaluation. The method has been implemented in ePaper, a personalised electronic newspaper prototype system. The method utilises a hierarchical ontology of news; it considers common and related concepts appearing in a user's profile on the one hand, and in a news item's profile on the other hand, and measures the ``hierarchical distances{''} between these concepts. On that basis it computes the similarity between item and user profiles and rank-orders the news items according to their relevance to each user. Design/methodology/approach - The paper evaluates the performance of the filtering method in an experimental setting. Each participant read news items obtained from an electronic newspaper and rated their relevance. Independently, the filtering method is applied to the same items and generated, for each participant, a list of news items ranked according to relevance. Findings - The results of the evaluations revealed that the filtering algorithm, which takes into consideration hierarchically related concepts, yielded significantly better results than a filtering method that takes only common concepts into consideration. The paper determined a best set of values (weights) of the hierarchical similarity parameters. It also found out that the quality of filtering improves as the number of items used for implicit updates of the profile increases, and that even with implicitly updated profiles, it is better to start with user-defined profiles. Originality/value - The proposed content-based filtering method can be used for filtering not only news items but items from any domain, and not only with a three-level hierarchical ontology but any-level ontology, in any language.}},

In this paper, the case of developing a learning resources' collaborative filtering service for an online community of teachers in Europe was examined. More specifically, a data set of evaluations of learning resources was collected from the teachers that use the European Schoolnet's learning resource portal. These evaluations were then used to support the experimental investigation of design choices for an online collaborative filtering service for the portal's learning resources. A candidate multi-attribute utility collaborative filtering algorithm was appropriately parameterized and tested for this purpose.

This marketing custom is already rising on the Internet and is imminent in Digital TV, where the massive sending of coupons leads to their devaluation and consumer indifference. The computing capabilities of these media permit to alleviate this problem by means of recommender systems, which are very useful tools in application domains that suffer from information overload. However, current recommender systems overlook the diversity of products and services available in the market, which gives rise to forming fake neighborhoods in collaborative filtering strategies. In this paper, we apply semantic reasoning techniques to avoid such fake neighborhoods and, thereby, improve the recommendation process. Furthermore, taking advantage of the Digital TV medium, we propose matching the recommended coupons to TV contents semantically related with them, in order to increase their redemption(1).}},

The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. Thus, the tagging information can be used to make recommendations. This paper presents an overview of the field of social tagging systems which can be used for extending the capabilities of recommender systems. Various limitations of the current generation of social tagging systems and possible extensions that can provide better recommendation capabilities are also considered.}},

In the ICF, instead of the standard Pearson coefficient, the user-user similarities are obtained by integrating the heat conduction and mass diffusion processes. The simulation results on a benchmark data set indicate that the corresponding algorithmic accuracy, measured by the ranking score, is improved by 6.7\% in the optimal case compared to the standard collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm. More importantly, the diversity of the recommendation lists is also improved by 63.6\%. Since the user similarity is crucial for the CF algorithm, this work may shed some light on how to improve the algorithmic performance by giving accurate similarity measurement.}},

    abstract                   = {{Personalization is becoming a key issue in designing effective e-learning systems and, in this context, a promising solution is represented by software agents. Usually, these systems provide the student with a student agent that interacts with a site agent associated with each e-learning site. However, in presence of a large number of students and of e-learning sites, the tasks of the agents are often onerous, even more if the student agents run on devices with limited resources. To face this problem, we propose a new multiagent learning system, called ISABEL. Our system provides each student, that are using a specific device, with a device agent able to autonomously monitor the student's behavior when accessing e-learning Web sites. Each site is associated, in its turn, with a teacher agent. When a student visits an e-learning site, the teacher agent collaborates with some tutor agents associated with the student, to provide him with useful recommendations. We present both theoretical and experimental results to show that this distributed approach introduces significant advantages in quality and efficiency of the recommendation activity with respect to the performances of other past recommenders.}},

In this paper, we study a personalized recommendation model making use of the ternary relations among users, objects and tags. We propose a measure of user similarity based oil his preference and tagging information. Two kinds of similarities between users are calculated by using a diffusion-based process, which are then integrated for recommendation. We test the proposed method in a standard collaborative filtering framework with three metrics: ranking score, Recall and Precision, and demonstrate that it performs better than the commonly used cosine similarity.

    abstract                   = {{In this paper I use philosophical accounts on the relationship between trust and knowledge in science to apprehend this relationship on the Web. I argue that trust and knowledge are fundamentally entangled in our epistemic practices. Yet despite this fundamental entanglement, we do not trust blindly. Instead we make use of knowledge to rationally place or withdraw trust. We use knowledge about the sources of epistemic content as well as general background knowledge to assess epistemic claims. Hence, although we may have a default to trust, we remain and should remain epistemically vigilant; we look out and need to look out for signs of insincerity and dishonesty in our attempts to know. A fundamental requirement for such vigilance is transparency: in order to critically assess epistemic agents, content and processes, we need to be able to access and address them. On the Web, this request for transparency becomes particularly pressing if (a) trust is placed in unknown human epistemic agents and (b) if it is placed in non-human agents, such as algorithms. I give examples of the entanglement between knowledge and trust on the Web and draw conclusions about the forms of transparency needed in such systems to support epistemically vigilant behaviour, which empowers users to become responsible and accountable knowers.}},

Social tagging systems (STSs) can provide three different types of recommendations: They can recommend 1) tags to users, based on what tags other users have used for the same items, 2) items to users, based on tags they have in common with other similar users, and 3) users with common social interest, based on common tags on similar items. However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are modeled by a 3-order tensor, on which multiway latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) method and the Kernel-SVD smoothing technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision.}},

Recommender systems help these end users by selecting a small but relevant subset of items for each user based on her/his preferences. This paper investigates the influence of affective metadata (metadata that describe the user's emotions) on the performance of a content-based recommender (CBR) system for images. The underlying assumption is that affective parameters are more closely related to the user's experience than generic metadata (e.g. genre) and are thus more suitable for separating the relevant items from the non-relevant. We propose a novel affective modeling approach based on users' emotive responses. We performed a user-interaction session and compared the performance of the recommender system with affective versus generic metadata. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the proposed affective parameters yield a significant improvement in the performance of the recommender system.}},

To adapt itself to a researcher's interests, the system takes into account what words have been used in a particular researcher's abstracts, and when these words have been used. The user model underlying the Personal Publication Assistant is based on a rational analysis of memory, and takes the form of a model of declarative memory as developed for the cognitive architecture ACT-R. We discuss an experiment testing the assumptions of this model and present a user study that validates the implementation of the Personal Publication Assistant. The user study shows that the Personal Publication Assistant can successfully make an initial selection of relevant papers from a large collection of scientific literature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

    abstract                   = {{User preferences discovery aims to learn the patterns of user preferences for various services or items such as movies. Preferences discovery is essential to the development of intelligent personalization applications. Based on decision and utility theories, traditional approaches to preferences discovery explicitly query users about the behavior of value function, or utility of every outcome with respect to each decision criterion. Consequently, these approaches are generally error-prone and labor intensive. Although implicit elicitation approaches have been proposed to address the above limitations, extent approaches largely ignore multi-valued nature of item features and uncertainty associated with item features and user preferences. To address uncertainty due to vagueness and imprecision, this research proposed a general framework for preferences discovery based on fuzzy set theories. In addition, new fuzzy models were created for preferences discovery and representation. Further, an algorithm was developed to predict user preferences with uncertainty, and visualization of item features, user feedback, and the discovered preferences helped improve the interpretation of the discovered knowledge. The results of the simulation evaluation using a benchmark movie dataset revealed that the proposed preference discovery method: (I) doubled the accuracy of preference discovery as compared to random prediction; and (2) outperformed conventional techniques in making movie recommendation. These findings suggest that fuzzy models are effective for preferences patterns discovery, and personalized recommendation application. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Besides its low cost of computational time, the experimental results on two real-world data sets, Del.icio.us and MovieLens, show that it can enhance the algorithmic accuracy and diversity. Especially, it provides more personalized recommendation when the assigned tags belong to more diverse topics. The proposed algorithm is particularly effective for small-degree objects, which reminds us of the well-known cold-start problem in recommender systems. Further empirical study shows that the proposed algorithm can significantly solve this problem in social tagging systems with heterogeneous object degree. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2010}},

Different from traditional recommender systems in the client-server architecture, our model is oriented to the peer-to-peer (P2P) environment without the centralized control. Among the P2P network of collaborative team members, each peer is deployed with one distributed knowledge recommender, which can supply proper knowledge resources to peers who may need them. This paper investigates the key techniques for implementing the distributed knowledge recommender model. Moreover, a series of simulation-based experiments are conducted by using the data from a real-world collaborative team in an enterprise. The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed model. This research paves the way for developing platforms that can share and manage large-scale distributed knowledge resources. This study also provides a new framework for simulating and studying individual or organizational behaviors of knowledge sharing in a collaborative team. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Besides traditional operations on photo sharing, Flickr also offers millions of groups for users to join in order to share photos with others, and the number of groups still increases daily. Choosing among so many options is challenging for users. As such, helping users easily find their desirable groups has become increasingly important. In this paper, we provide a systematic experimental evaluation of several collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend groups for Flickr users. In particular, we design and compare seven Flickr group recommendation models: three memory-based models and four model-based models. Our results suggest that model-based approaches are beneficial compared with memory-based approaches in terms of top-k recommendation metric. Models with tags perform well for sparse data, whereas models without tags are more suitable for dense data. Furthermore, incorporating tags in the recommendation algorithms leads to an improvement of precision on the top 2\% performance.}},

    abstract                   = {{Collaborative filtering is a popular recommendation technique, which suggests items to users by exploiting past user-item interactions involving affinities between pairs of users or items. In spite of their huge success they suffer from a range of problems, the most fundamental being that of data sparsity. When the rating matrix is sparse, local similarity measures yield a poor neighborhood set thus affecting the recommendation quality. In such cases global similarity measures can be used to enrich the neighborhood set by considering transitive relationships among users even in the absence of any common experiences. In this work we propose a recommender system framework utilizing both local and global similarities, taking into account not only the overall sparsity in the rating data, but also sparsity at the user-item level. Several schemes are proposed, based on various sparsity measures pertaining to the active user, for the estimation of the parameter alpha, that allows the variation of the importance given to the global user similarity with regards to local user similarity. Furthermore, we propose an automatic scheme for weighting the various sparsity measures, through evolutionary approach, to obtain a unified measure of sparsity (UMS). In order to take maximum possible advantage of the various sparsity measures relating to an active user, a scheme based on the UMS is suggested for estimating alpha. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed estimates of alpha, markedly, outperform the schemes for which alpha is kept constant across all predictions (fixed-alpha schemes), on accuracy of predicted ratings.

    abstract                   = {{Collaborative filtering (CF) systems exploit previous ratings and similarity in user behavior to recommend the top-k objects/records which are potentially most interesting to the user assuming a single score per object. However, in various applications, a record (e. g., hotel) maybe rated on several attributes (value, service, etc.), in which case simply returning the ones with the highest overall scores fails to capture the individual attribute characteristics and to accommodate different selection criteria. In order to enhance the flexibility of CF, we propose Collaborative Filtering Skyline (CFS), a general framework that combines the advantages of CF with those of the skyline operator. CFS generates a personalized skyline for each user based on scores of other users with similar behavior. The personalized skyline includes objects that are good on certain aspects, and eliminates the ones that are not interesting on any attribute combination. Although the integration of skylines and CF has several attractive properties, it also involves rather expensive computations. We face this challenge through a comprehensive set of algorithms and optimizations that reduce the cost of generating personalized skylines. In addition to exact skyline processing, we develop an approximate method that provides error guarantees. Finally, we propose the top-k personalized skyline, where the user specifies the required output cardinality.}},

More than a decade of research has resulted in numerous algorithms, although no comparison of the different strategies has been made. In fact, a universally accepted way of evaluating a collaborative filtering algorithm does not exist yet. In this work, we compare different techniques found in the literature, and we study the characteristics of each one, highlighting their principal strengths and weaknesses. Several experiments have been performed, using the most popular metrics and algorithms. Moreover, two new metrics designed to measure the precision on good items have been proposed. The results have revealed the weaknesses of many algorithms in extracting information from user profiles especially under sparsity conditions. We have also confirmed the good results of SVD-based techniques already reported by other authors. As an alternative, we present a new approach based on the interpretation of the tendencies or differences between users and items. Despite its extraordinary simplicity, in our experiments, it obtained noticeably better results than more complex algorithms. In fact, in the cases analyzed, its results are at least equivalent to those of the best approaches studied. Under sparsity conditions, there is more than a 20\% improvement in accuracy over the traditional user-based algorithms, while maintaining over 90\% coverage. Moreover, it is much more efficient computationally than any other algorithm, making it especially adequate for large amounts of data.}},

In contrast to an explicit definition of each individual item, configurable products such as computers, financial service portfolios, and cars are represented in the form of a configuration knowledge base that describes the properties or allowed instances. Although the knowledge representation used is different compared to nonconfigurable products, the decision support requirements remain the same: users have to be supported in finding a solution that fits their wishes and needs. In this article we show how recommendation technologies can be applied for supporting the configuration of products. In addition to existing approaches we discuss relevant issues for future research.}},

    abstract                   = {{A large number of collaborative filtering algorithms have been proposed in the literature as the foundation of automated recommender systems. However, the underlying justification for these algorithms is lacking, and their relative performances are typically domain and data dependent. In this paper, we aim to develop initial understanding of the recommendation model/algorithm validation and selection issues based on the graph topological modeling methodology. By representing the input data in the form of consumer-product interactions as a bipartite graph, the consumer-product graph, we develop bipartite graph topological measures to capture patterns that exist in the input data relevant to the transaction-based recommendation task. We observe the deviations of these topological measures of real-world consumer-product graphs from the expected values for simulated random bipartite graphs. These deviations help explain why certain collaborative filtering algorithms work for particular recommendation data sets. They can also serve as the basis for a comprehensive model selection framework that ``recommends{''} appropriate collaborative filtering algorithms given characteristics of the data set under study. We validate our approach using three real-world recommendation data sets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bipartite graph topological measures in selection and validation of commonly used heuristic-based recommendation algorithms, the user-based, item-based, and graph-based algorithms.}},

However, in current approaches, the weights of contextual information are the same, which limits the accuracy of the results. This paper aims to propose a context-aware recommender system by extracting, measuring and incorporating significant contextual information in recommendation. The approach is based on rough set theory and collaborative filtering. It involves a three-steps process. At first, significant attributes to represent contextual information are extracted and measured to identify recommended items based on rough set theory. Then the users' similarity is measured in a target context consideration. Furthermore collaborative filtering is adopted to recommend appropriate items. The evaluation experiments show that the proposed approach is helpful to improve the recommendation quality.}},

    abstract                   = {{The emergence of Web 2.0 and the consequent success of social network Web sites such as Delicious and Flickr introduce us to a new concept called social bookmarking, or tagging. Tagging is the action of connecting a relevant user-defined keyword to a document, image, or video, which helps the user to better organize and share their collections of interesting stuff. With the rapid growth of Web 2.0, tagged data is becoming more and more abundant on the social network Web sites. An interesting problem is how to automate the process of making tag recommendations to users when a new resource becomes available. In this article, we address the issue of tag recommendation from a machine learning perspective. From our empirical observation of two large-scale datasets, we first argue that the user-centered approach for tag recommendation is not very effective in practice. Consequently, we propose two novel document-centered approaches that are capable of making effective and efficient tag recommendations in real scenarios. The first, graph-based, method represents the tagged data in two bipartite graphs, (document, tag) and (document, word), then finds document topics by leveraging graph partitioning algorithms. The second, prototype-based, method aims at finding the most representative documents within the data collections and advocates a sparse multiclass Gaussian process classifier for efficient document classification. For both methods, tags are ranked within each topic cluster/class by a novel ranking method. Recommendations are performed by first classifying a new document into one or more topic clusters/classes, and then selecting the most relevant tags from those clusters/classes as machine-recommended tags. Experiments on real-world data from Delicious, CiteULike, and BibSonomy examine the quality of tag recommendation as well as the efficiency of our recommendation algorithms. The results suggest that our document-centered models can substantially improve the performance of tag recommendations when compared to the user-centered methods, as well as topic models LDA and SVM classifiers.}},

First, we present a framework for incorporating aggregate rating information and apply this framework to the aforementioned individual rating models. Then we formally show that this additional aggregate rating information provides more accurate recommendations of individual items to individual users. Further, we experimentally confirm this theoretical finding by demonstrating on several datasets that the aggregate rating information indeed leads to better predictions of unknown ratings. We also propose scalable methods for incorporating this aggregate information and test our approaches on large datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggregate rating information can also be used as a solution to the cold start problem of recommender systems.}},

    abstract                   = {{Automated Collaborative Filtering (ACF) refers to a group of algorithms used in recommender systems, a research topic that has received considerable attention due to its e-commerce applications. However, existing techniques are rarely capable of dealing with imperfections in user-supplied ratings. When such imperfections (e. g., ambiguities) cannot be avoided, designers resort to simplifying assumptions that impair the system's performance and utility. We have developed a novel technique referred to as CoFiDS-Collaborative Filtering based on Dempster-Shafer belief-theoretic framework-that can represent a wide variety of data imperfections, propagate them throughout the decision-making process without the need to make simplifying assumptions, and exploit contextual information. With its DS-theoretic predictions, the domain expert can either obtain a ``hard{''} decision or can narrow the set of possible predictions to a smaller set. With its capability to handle data imperfections, CoFiDS widens the applicability of ACF to such critical and sensitive domains as medical decision support systems and defense-related applications. We describe the theoretical foundation of the system and report experiments with a benchmark movie data set. We explore some essential aspects of CoFiDS' behavior and show that its performance compares favorably with other ACF systems.}},

This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of errorRof such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of errorR^{ast}--the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in theM-category case thatR^{ast} leq R leq R^{ast}(2 --MR^{ast}/(M-1)), where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

    abstract     = {{A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents ( \'u?\'u semantic structure\'u?\'u) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 or-thogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are re-turned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.}},

The effort involved for a user to rate a document may outweigh any benefit received, leading to a shortage of ratings. One approach to this problem is to use implicit ratings: where user actions are recorded and a rating is inferred from the recorded data. This paper discusses the costs and benefits of using implicit ratings for information filtering applications.}},

Collaborative filtering combines the informed opinions of humans to make personalized, accurate predictions. Content-based filtering uses the speed of computers to make complete, fast predictions. In this work, we present a new filtering approach that combines the coverage and speed of content-filters with the depth of collaborative filtering. We apply our research approach to an online newspaper, an as yet untapped opportunity for filters useful to the wide-spread news reading populace. We present the design of our filtering system and describe the results from preliminary experiments that suggest merits to our approach. }},

In this paper, we investigate several techniques for analyzing large-scale purchase and preference data for the purpose of producing useful recommendations to customers. In particular, we apply a collection of algorithms such as traditional data mining, nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering, and dimensionality reduction on two different data sets. The first data set was derive from the web-purchasing transaction of a large E-Commerce company, while the second data set was collected from MovieLens movie recommendation site. For the experimental purpose, we divide teh recommendation generation process into three sub processes: representation of input data, neighborhood formation and recommendation generation. We devise different techniques for different sub processes and apply their combinations on our data sets to compare for recommendation quality and performance.}},

    abstract     = {A personalized product recommendation is an enabling mechanism to overcome information overload occurred when shopping in an Internet marketplace. Collaborative filtering has been known to be one of the most successful recommendation methods, but its application to e-commerce has exposed well-known limitations such as sparsity and scalability, which would lead to poor recommendations. This paper suggests a personalized recommendation methodology by which we are able to get further effectiveness and quality of recommendations when applied to an Internet shopping mall. The suggested methodology is based on a variety of data mining techniques such as web usage mining, decision tree induction, association rule mining and the product taxonomy. For the evaluation of the methodology, we implement a recommender system using intelligent agent and data warehousing technologies.},

@article{Herlocker2002,
    abstract     = {Collaborative filtering systems predict a user's interest in new items based on the recommendations of other people with similar interests. Instead of performing content indexing or content analysis, collaborative filtering systems rely entirely on interest ratings from members of a participating community. Since predictions are based on human ratings, collaborative filtering systems have the potential to provide filtering based on complex attributes, such as quality, taste, or aesthetics. Many implementations of collaborative filtering apply some variation of the neighborhood-based prediction algorithm. Many variations of similarity metrics, weighting approaches, combination measures, and rating normalization have appeared in each implementation. For these parameters and others, there is no consensus as to which choice of technique is most appropriate for what situations, nor how significant an effect on accuracy each parameter has. Consequently, every person implementing a collaborative filtering system must make hard design choices with little guidance. This article provides a set of recommendations to guide design of neighborhood-based prediction systems, based on the results of an empirical study. We apply an analysis framework that divides the neighborhood-based prediction approach into three components and then examines variants of the key parameters in each component. The three components identified are similarity computation, neighbor selection, and rating combination.},

    abstract     = {{Principal component analysis is central to the study of multivariate data. Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model- based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comprehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.}},

    abstract    = {Ubiquitous computing is a vision of future in which a computing technology becomes pervasive. One of the most important attributes in ubiquitous computing is context- awareness. The application that the user's contexts are changed continuously over time normally requires a just-in-time recommendation. This paper describes a new just-in-time recommendation method using multi-agents for context-awareness in ubiquitous computing environment. For the just-in-time recommendation, we locally store the recommendation information that the user is likely to need in the near future based on predictions. To predict the information that be expected to be needed by the user, we use data mining methods. We propose a JITR Server Context Agent and a JITR Client Context Agent . They make the just-in-time recommendation continuously with the change of user's contexts and solve the limitation of storage. We explain our method with an example. Several experiments are performed and the experimental results show that our method has a good recommendation performance.},

Through the Internet, different business entities can now easily interact with each other and then have their transactions within a minimum time. However, the advanced hardware facilities for Internet infrastructure and the entrancing Web sites are not the only decisive factors to guarantee a successful business in the electronic market. To enable the transactions, the problems that ensue during the complicated activities in electronic commerce have to be resolved. This paper presents an agent-based system to support two types of activities most related to the decision-making process in the Internet commerce. The first part of our system is for interactive recommendation; and the second part, for automated negotiation. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate their corresponding performance and the results show the efficiency of the proposed system and its potential toward the future electronic market.},

@article{Masthoff2004,
    abstract     = {Watching television tends to be a social activity. So, adaptive television needs to adapt to groups of users rather than to individual users. In this paper, we discuss different strategies for combining individual user models to adapt to groups, some of which are inspired by Social Choice Theory. In a first experiment, we explore how humans select a sequence of items for a group to watch, based on data about the individuals' preferences. The results show that humans use some of the strategies such as the Average Strategy (a.k.a. Additive Utilitarian), the Average Without Misery Strategy and the Least Misery Strategy, and care about fairness and avoiding individual misery. In a second experiment, we investigate how satisfied people believe they would be with sequences chosen by different strategies, and how their satisfaction corresponds with that predicted by a number of satisfaction functions. The results show that subjects use normalization, deduct misery, and use the ratings in a non-linear way. One of the satisfaction functions produced reasonable, though not completely correct predictions. According to our subjects, the sequences produced by five strategies give satisfaction to all individuals in the group. The results also show that subjects put more emphasis than expected on showing the best rated item to each individual (at a cost of misery for another individual), and that the ratings of the first and last items in the sequence are especially important. In a final experiment, we explore the influence viewing an item can have on the ratings of other items. This is important for deciding the order in which to present items. The results show an effect of both mood and topical relatedness.},

    abstract  = {Internet-based recommender systems have traditionally employed collaborative filtering techniques to deliver relevant "digital" results to users. In the mobile Internet however, recommendations typically involve "physical" entities (e.g., restaurants), requiring additional user effort for fulfillment. Thus, in addition to the inherent requirements of high scalability and low latency, we must also take into account a "convenience" metric in making recommendations. In this paper, we propose an enhanced collaborative filtering solution that uses location as a key criterion for generating recommendations. We frame the discussion in the context of our "restaurant recommender" system, and describe preliminary results that indicate the utility of such an approach. We conclude with a look at open issues in this space, and motivate a future discussion on the business impact and implications of mining the data in such systems},

It is important to consider users 'contexts in information recommendation as users' preference change with context. However, currently there are few methods which take into account users' contexts (e.g. time, place, the situation and so on). Thus, we extend the functionality of a Support Vector Machines (SVM), a popular classifier method used between two classes, by adding axes of context to the feature space in order to consider the users' context. We then applied the Context-Aware SVM (C-SVM) and the Collaborative Filtering System with Context-Aware SVM (C-SVM-CF) to a recommendation system for restaurants and then examined the effectiveness of each approach.},

This paper first introduces three alternative strategies to achieve program recommendation for multiple television viewers, discusses, and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages respectively, and then chooses the strategy based on user profile merging as our solution. The selected strategy first merges all user profiles to construct a common user profile, and then uses a recommendation approach to generate a common program recommendation list for the group according to the merged user profile. This paper then describes in detail the user profile merging scheme, the key technology of the strategy, which is based on total distance minimization. The evaluation results proved that the merging result can appropriately reflect the preferences of the majority of members within the group, and the proposed recommendation strategy is effective for multiple viewers watching TV together.},

After a brief introduction to SVD, where some of its previous applications in Recommender Systems are revisited, we proceed with a full description of our proposed method which utilizes \{SVD\} and demographic data at various points of the filtering procedure in order to improve the quality of the generated predictions. We test the efficiency of the resulting approach on two commonly used \{CF\} approaches (User-based and Item-based CF). The experimental part of this work involves a number of variations of the proposed approach. The results show that the combined utilization of \{SVD\} with demographic data is promising, since it does not only tackle some of the recorded problems of Recommender Systems, but also assists in increasing the accuracy of systems employing it.},

    abstract     = {Collaborative filtering is one of the most successful and widely used methods of automated product recommendation in online stores. The most critical component of the method is the mechanism of finding similarities among users using product ratings data so that products can be recommended based on the similarities. The calculation of similarities has relied on traditional distance and vector similarity measures such as Pearson's correlation and cosine which, however, have been seldom questioned in terms of their effectiveness in the recommendation problem domain. This paper presents a new heuristic similarity measure that focuses on improving recommendation performance under cold-start conditions where only a small number of ratings are available for similarity calculation for each user. Experiments using three different datasets show the superiority of the measure in new user cold-start conditions.},

    abstract    = {Many e-commerce sites use a recommendation system to filter the specific information that a user wants out of an overload of information. Currently, the usefulness of the recommendation is defined by its accuracy. However, findings that users are not satisfied only with accuracy have been reported. We consider that a recommendation having only accuracy is unsatisfactory. For this reason, we define the usefulness of a recommendation as its ability to recommend an item that the user does not know, but may like. To improve user satisfaction levels with recommendation lists, we propose an alternative recommendation algorithm that increases the diversity of the recommended items. We examined items that appeal to several different taste tendencies to create a list and achieved diversity in that list. First, we created a similarity network of items by using item rating data. Second, we clustered the items in the network and identified the topics that appealed to the same preference tendency. Our proposed algorithm was able to include items covering several topics in the recommendation list. To evaluate the effect on user satisfaction levels, we used our algorithm to make a recommendation list for DVD items carried by Amazon.co.jp and conducted a questionnaire survey. The results showed higher levels of user satisfaction with our list than a list created using Collaborative Filtering (CF).},

@inproceedings{Cong2009,
    abstract  = {We introduce the novel notion of explanation- based diversification to address the well-known problem of over- specialization in item recommendations. Over-specialization in recommender systems leads to result sets with items that are too similar to one another, thus reducing the diversity of results and limiting user choices. Traditionally, the problem is addressed through attribute-based diversification-grouping items in the result set that share many common attributes (e.g., genre for movies) and selecting only a limited number of items from each group. It is, however, not always applicable, especially for social content recommendations. For example, attributes may not be available as in the case of recommending URLs for users of del.icio.us. Explanation-based diversification provides a novel and complementary alternative-it leverages the reason for which a particular item is being recommended (i.e., explanation)-for diversifying the results, without the need to access the attributes of the items. In this paper, we formally define the problem of explanation-based diversification and, without going into the details of the actual diversification process, demonstrate its effectiveness on a real world data set, Yahoo! Movies.},

As IF techniques usually perform a progressive removal of non-relevant content according to the information stored in a user profile, recommendation algorithms process information about user interests- acquired in an explicit (e.g., letting users express their opinion about items) or implicit (e.g., studying some behavioral features) way - and exploit these data to generate a list of recommended items. Although each type of filtering method has its own weaknesses and strengths, preference handling is one of the core issues in the design of every recommender system: since these systems aim to guide users in a personalized way to interesting or useful objects in a large space of possible options, it is important for them to accurately catch and model user preferences. The paper provides a general overview of the approaches to learning preference models in the context of recommender systems.}},

Most existing frameworks that support group applications/services focus on lower level issues such as group membership management or group communication, failing to give attention to context-awareness, while those that address context-awareness are mostly application specific. However, the introduction of a generic framework for the above situation can be challenging for several reasons, such as the heterogeneity of the applications/services and the complexity of interpreting group information compared to single user information. This paper proposes a generic framework for group knowledge management that overcomes these challenges. The framework supports the above mentioned applications/services in extracting group knowledge regarding the involved entities. A prototype implementation including functionality to query group knowledge is presented as well.},

In the tourist sector, the use of tourist Web based sites has got a great success due to the fact that the easy integration of tourist business processes in Web based tools. In this contribution, we introduce a hybrid recommender system for restaurants, collaborative and knowledge-based, that is able to provide recommendations in any required situation by the users/customers; besides it provides information referred by Google Maps, regarding the recommendations. Such a system has been developed for our province, Ja\'un (Spain), but it can be easily extended for any other geographic area.}},

It has no value in itself; the value is measured by the usefulness of applying it in some process. Such a process has info-needs that have to be satisfied. The concept to measure this is the economical term utility. In general, utility depends on the user and its context, i.e., it is subjective. Here, we introduce levels of contexts from general to individual. We illustrate that Case-Based Reasoning on the lower, i.e., more personal levels CBR is quite useful, in particular in comparison with traditional informational retrieval methods.}},

A large number of operations have been defined for this type of fuzzy sets, and several applications have been developed in the last years. In this paper we describe hesitant fuzzy sets. They are another generalization of fuzzy sets. Although similar in intention to IFS, some basic differences on their interpretation and on their operators exist. In this paper we review their definition, the main results and we present an extension principle, which permits to generalize existing operations on fuzzy sets to this new type of fuzzy sets. We also discuss their use in decision making.},

    abstract  = {Mobile tourist guides have been in the spotlight during the past decade resulting in many prototypes, either full-fledged standalone mobile applications or web-based applications. Particular emphasis has been given to personalisation of services, typically based on travel recommender systems used to assist tourists in choosing places to visit; these systems address an important aspect of personalization and hence reduce the information burden for the user. However, existing systems fail to exploit information, behaviors, ideas, evaluations, assessments, ratings, etc, by other tourists with similar interests, which provide ground for the cooperative production of tourist content and travel recommendations. In this paper we extend this notion of travel recommender systems utilizing collaborative filtering techniques for deriving improved recommendations. We also propose the use of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) installations around tourist sites for providing mobile users convenient and inexpensive means for uploading tourist information and ratings about Points of Interest (POI) via their mobile devices. User ratings uploaded through WSN infrastructures are weighted higher to differentiate between users that rate POIs using the mobile tourist guide application in direct proximity of the POI and others using the Internet away from the POI.},

We investigate the properties of trust propagation on networks, based on a simple metric of trust transitivity. We investigate analytically the percolation properties of trust transitivity in random networks with arbitrary degree distribution, and compare with numerical realizations. We find that the existence of a non-zero fraction of absolute trust (i.e. entirely confident trust) is a requirement for the viability of global trust propagation in large systems: The average pair-wise trust is marked by a discontinuous transition at a specific fraction of absolute trust, below which it vanishes. Furthermore, we perform an extensive analysis of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) web of trust, in view of the concepts introduced. We compare different scenarios of trust distribution: community- and authority-centered. We find that these scenarios lead to sharply different patterns of trust propagation, due to the segregation of authority hubs and densely-connected communities. While the authority-centered scenario is more efficient, and leads to higher average trust values, it favours weakly-connected ?ringe?nodes, which are directly trusted by authorities. The community-centered scheme, on the other hand, favours nodes with intermediate degrees, in detriment of the authorities and its ?ringe?peers.},

@article{Yan2010,
    abstract     = {Conventional wisdom suggests that investors' independent biases should cancel each other out and have little impact on equilibrium at the aggregate level. In contrast to this intuition, this paper analyzes models with biased investors and finds that biases often have a significant impact on the equilibrium even if they are independent across investors. First, independent biases affect the equilibrium asset price if investor demand for the asset is a nonlinear function of the bias. Second, even if the demand function is linear in the bias, it may still have a significant impact on the equilibrium because of the fluctuation of the wealth distribution. An initial run-up of the stock price makes optimistic investors richer, which then further pushes the stock price up and leads to lower future returns. This effect can lead to price overshooting, i.e., a negative expected future return. Similarly, an initial drop of the stock price leads to higher future returns. Simple calibrations show that a modest amount of biases can have a large impact on the equilibrium.},

Past studies have shown that overweight and obese children are socially marginalized. This research tests (1) if this is true when we account for the sample size of each group, (2) does this phenomenon hold over time and (3) is it obesity or social marginalization that precedes in time. Our results show that when the sample size for each group is considered, the share of friendship is conforming to the size of the group. This conformity seems to increase over time as the population becomes more obese. Finally, we find that obesity precedes social marginalization which lends credence to the notion that obesity causes social marginalization and not vice versa.},

So, for instance, music recommendations while the user is traveling by car should take into account the current traffic condition or the driver's mood. This requires the acquisition of ratings for items in several alternative contextual situations, to extract from this data the true dependency of the ratings on the contextual situation. In this paper, in order to simplify the in-context rating acquisition process, we consider the individual perceptions of the users about the influence of context on their decisions. We have elaborated a system design methodology where we assume that users can be requested to judge: a) if a contextual factor (e.g., the traffic state) is relevant for their decision making task, and b) how they would rate an item assuming that a certain contextual condition (e.g., traffic is chaotic) holds. Using these evaluations we show that it is possible to build an effective context-aware mobile recommender system.}},

A good thing is that it states that the evaluation is done with recommend all items approach, i.e., not only the not-rated in the group. A bad thing is that it tunes a co-rated parameter. This makes that recommendations with a lot of ratings are predicted using the users in the detected group (check this). In the social network, it substracts 0.1 to all edges weight, leading to elimination of low weight edges less, to eliminate noisy connections. therefore, if there are enough ratings, the prediction is the average rating, otherwise it uses an item-item model to predict the rating.

Taken as a whole, these relations define an implicit social structure which can influence the decision outcome. Aspects of this structure are founded on interpersonal affinity between parties to the negotiation, on assigned roles, and on the recognition of status characteristics, such as relevant domain expertise. This paper build upon a methodology aimed at extracting an explicit representation of such social structures using meeting transcripts as a data source. Whereas earlier results demonstrated that the method presented here can identify groups of decision-makers with a contextual affinity (i.e., membership in a given medical specialty or voting clique), we now can extract meaningful status hierarchies, and can identify differing facilitation styles among committee chairs. Use of this method is demonstrated on the transcripts of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel meeting transcripts; nevertheless, the approach presented here is extensible to other domains and requires only a meeting transcript as input.},

    abstract    = {The global financial crisis brought a serious collapse involving a \'usystemic\'u meltdown. Internet technology and globalization have increased the chances for interaction between countries and people. The global economy has become more complex than ever before. Mark Buchanan [12] indicated that agent-based computer models will prevent another financial crisis and has been particularly influential in contributing insights. There are two reasons why culture-sensitive agent on the financial market has become so important. Therefore, the aim of this article is to establish a culture-sensitive agent and forecast the process of change regarding herding behavior in the financial market. We based our study on the Kirman's Ant Model[4,5] and Hofstede's Natational Culture[11] to establish our culture-sensitive agent based model. Kirman's Ant Model is quite famous and describes financial market herding behavior from the expectations of the future of financial investors. Hofstede's cultural consequence used the staff of IBM in 72 different countries to understand the cultural difference. As a result, this paper focuses on one of the five dimensions of culture from Hofstede: individualism versus collectivism and creates a culture-sensitive agent and predicts the process of change regarding herding behavior in the financial market. To conclude, this study will be of importance in explaining the herding behavior with cultural factors, as well as in providing researchers with a clearer understanding of how herding beliefs of people about different cultures relate to their finance market strategies.},

    abstract    = {One sensible way to reduce healthcare costs is to harness market forces, where practical, to nurture competition and innovation. Lower prices and improved services should follow. However, the switch to market pricing is not an easy one. Medicare's experience with medical supplies illustrates the challenges and offers some important lessons. The key lesson is that government programs can benefit from introducing market methods, but doing so requires good market design\'usomething that may not come naturally to the implementing agency, especially in light of political forces and organizational inertia. An auction design for Medicare Durable Medical Equipment is presented. The design addresses the flaws in the current program. Bids are binding commitments. Each bid binds the bidder to particular performance obligations depending on the auction outcome. The bids are made credible through a rigorous qualification one month before the auction. Each bidder provides a financial guarantee in the form of a bid bond or a deposit in proportion to the bidder's capacity. Capacity is objectively estimated based on the bidder's supply in recent years. Each winner provides a performance guarantee in proportion to the winner's estimated volume won. The auction establishes a market clearing price for each product in each service area. The price paid to all suppliers is the clearing price that balances supply and demand. These prices are found in a simultaneous descending clock auction, a simple price discovery process that allows both substitutions across items and complementarities. Competition in the auction comes from new entry or the expansion of existing suppliers into new product categories and service areas. After the auction, the winners compete for Medicare beneficiaries by offering quality products and services. Thus, beneficiary choice is used to further strengthen incentives to provide high quality products and services.},

We use qualitative reasoning techniques which to our knowledge have never been applied to modeling crowd behaviors, nor in particular to demonstrations. Such modeling may not only contribute to the police decision making process, but can also provide a great opportunity to test existing theories in social science. We incrementally present and compare three qualitative models, based on social science theories. The results show that while two of these models fail to predict the outcomes of real-world events reported and analyzed in the literature, one model is successful. We believe that this demonstrates the efficacy of qualitative reasoning in the development and testing of social sciences theories.},

We found that while cascades do sometimes occur, their effects depend critically on the accuracies of individual quality assessments of information contents. Contrary to predictions of cascade models of information flow, quality-based cascades tend to reinforce the propagation of individual quality assessments rather than being the primary sources that drive the assessments. We found even small increase in individual accuracies will significantly improve the overall effectiveness of crowdsourcing quality control. Implication to domains such as online health information Web sites or product reviews are discussed.},

Attempts over more than a century to provide a decentralized market dynamic that implements market equilibrium have failed. The reason is that a system of decentralized markets is a complex dynamical system in which the major form of learning is through experience (adaptive expectations) and imitating successful others (replicator dynamics). I will present a model of decentralized market exchange where each individual produces one good and consumes many. I will show that an agentbased model of this economy converges to market equilibrium and is highly impervious to shocks. I will also present a model in which agents are firms and households, as in the standard Walrasian model. I will show that an agent-based model in this case converges strongly to market equilibrium, but with considerable excess volatility and large excursions from equilibrium. This is characteristic of error terms with \'ufat tails\'u as characterized in the complexity literature, and is due to the tendency of agents to imitate the successful, which leads to strongly correlated error distributions.},

    abstract    = {We simulate how a set of different UN policies for peace-keeping operations is likely to affect the global incidence of internal armed conflict. The simulation is based on a statistical model that estimates the efficacy of UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs) in preventing the onset, escalation, continuation, and recurrence of internal armed conflict. The model takes into account a set of important conflict predictors for which we have projections up to 2035 from the UN and the IIASA. The estimates are based on a 1970-2008 cross-sectional dataset of changes between conflict levels and new data on PKO budgets and mandates. The simulations show a strong effect of PKOs on the global incidence of major conflicts, although restricted to operations with robust mandates. Extensive use of \'utransformational' PKOs can reduce the global incidence of the most lethal conflicts with 65%.},

    abstract     = {Recommender systems are useful in reducing information overload and improving decision making. Utility-based recommender systems provide recommendations based on the computation of the utility of each item for the user. Some utility-elicitation methods have been developed on the basis of multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) to represent a decision maker\'us complete preference. This study investigates whether these utility-based techniques outperform the traditional content-based technique for online recommendations. A laboratory experiment was conducted in two e-commerce contexts to compare the decomposed and holistic utility-based methods, simple multi-attribute rating technique exploiting ranks (SMARTER) and radial basis function network (RBFN), with the content-based method vector space model (VSM) in terms of recommendation accuracy, time expense, and user perceptions. The results demonstrate that the performances of utility-based methods depend on recommendation contexts. Furthermore, this study proposes guidelines for choosing appropriate recommendation methods in different contexts.},

We propose two models: 1) the Afghan COIN social influence model, to represent how attitudes of local leaders are affected by repeated interactions with other local leaders, insurgents, and counterinsurgents, and 2) the nonlethal targeting model, a nonlinear programming (NLP) optimization formulation that identifies a strategy for assigning k US agents to produce the greatest arithmetic mean of the expected long-term attitude of the population. We demonstrate in an experiment the merits of the optimization model in nonlethal targeting, which performs significantly better than both doctrine-based and random methods of assignment in a large network.},

However, a lot of information is lost in this way, since two products with the same similarity to a query can differ from this query on a completely different set of product characteristics. When using a two dimensional map based visualization of the recommendations, it is possible to retain part of this information.

Effective EBP can reduce delinquency, aggression, violence, bullying and substance abuse among youth. Unfortunately the outcomes of EBP implemented in natural settings usually tend to be lower than in clinical trials, which has motivated the need to study EBP implementations. In this paper we propose to model EBP implementations in natural settings as stochastic dynamic processes. Specifically, we propose Markov Decision Process (MDP) for modeling and dynamic optimization of such EBP implementations. We illustrate these concepts using simple numerical examples and discuss potential challenges in using such approaches in practice.},

    abstract    = {Negotiation is a process by which interested parties confer with the aim of reaching agreements. The dissemination of technologies such as the Internet has created opportunities for computer agents to negotiate with people, despite being distributed geographically and in time. The inclusion of people presents novel problems for the design of autonomous agent negotiation strategies. People do not adhere to the optimal, monolithic strategies that can be derived analytically, as is the case in settings comprising computer agents alone. Their negotiation behavior is affected by a multitude of social and psychological factors, such as social attributes that influence negotiation deals (e.g., social welfare, inequity aversion) and traits of individual negotiators (e.g., altruism, trustworthiness, helpfulness). Furthermore, culture plays an important role in their decision making and people of varying cultures differ in the way they make offers and fulfill their commitments in negotiation. In this talk I will present the following two agents that negotiate well with people by modeling several social factors: The PURB agent that can adapt successfully to people from different cultures in complete information settings, and the SIGAL agent that learns to negotiate successfully with people in games where people can choose to reveal private information. These agents were evaluated in extensive experiments including people from three countries. I will also demonstrate how agents' opponent modeling of people can be improved by using models from the social sciences.},

    abstract    = {As systems science methodologies have begun to emerge as a set of innovative approaches to address complex problems in behavioral, social science, and public health research, some apparent conflicts with traditional statistical methodologies for public health have arisen. Computational modeling is an approach set in context that integrates diverse sources of data to test the plausibility of working hypotheses and to elicit novel ones. Statistical models are reductionist approaches geared towards proving the null hypothesis. While these two approaches may seem contrary to each other, we propose that they are in fact complementary and can be used jointly to advance solutions to complex problems. Outputs from statistical models can be fed into computational models, and outputs from computational models can lead to further empirical data collection and statistical models. Together, this presents an iterative process that refines the models and contributes to a greater understanding of the problem and its potential solutions. The purpose of this panel is to foster communication and understanding between statistical and computational modelers. Our goal is to shed light on the differences between the approaches and convey what kinds of research inquiries each one is best for addressing and how they can serve complementary (and synergistic) roles in the research process, to mutual benefit. For each approach the panel will cover the relevant \'uassumptions\'u and how the differences in what is assumed can foster misunderstandings. The interpretations of the results from each approach will be compared and contrasted and the limitations for each approach will be delineated. We will use illustrative examples from CompMod, the Comparative Modeling Network for Childhood Obesity Policy. The panel will also incorporate interactive discussions with the audience on the issues raised here.},

Task-oriented groups are created explicitly to perform a task, and all members derive benefits from task completion. However, even in cases when all group members act in a way that is locally optimal for task completion, social forces that have mild effects on choice of associates can have a measurable impact on task completion performance. In this paper, we show how our simulation can be used to model the impact of stereotypes on group formation. In our simulation, stereotypes are based on observable features, learned from prior experience, and only affect an agent's link formation preferences. Even without assuming stereotypes affect the agents' willingness or ability to complete tasks, the long-term modifications that stereotypes have on the agents' social network impair the agents' ability to form groups with sufficient diversity of skills, as compared to agents who form links randomly. An interesting finding is that this effect holds even in cases where stereotype preference and skill existence are completely uncorrelated.},

In STS however, we face new challenges. Users are interested in finding not only content, but also tags and even other users. Moreover, while traditional recommender systems usually operate over 2-way data arrays, STS data is represented as a third-order tensor or a hypergraph with hyperedges denoting (user, resource, tag) triples. In this chapter, we survey the most recent and state-of-the-art work about a whole new generation of recommender systems built to serve STS.We describe (a) novel facets of recommenders for STS, such as user, resource, and tag recommenders, (b) new approaches and algorithms for dealing with the ternary nature of STS data, and (c) recommender systems deployed in real world STS. Moreover, a concise comparison between existing works is presented, through which we identify and point out new research directions.},

Uncovering these behaviors not only allows us to gain deep insights of the users, but also pave the way to decipher how social links are formed. In this paper, we propose a general framework to define user link formation behaviors using well studied local link structures (i.e., triads and dyads) in a dynamic social network where links are formed at different timestamps. Depending on the role a user plays in a link structure, we derive different types of link formation behaviors . We develop models for these behaviors and measure them for a set of users in an Epinions dataset.},

Of course RSs do recommend, but this assumption is biased, with no help of the title, towards the \'urecommending\'u the system will do. There is another reason for presenting an item to the user: to learn more about his/her preferences, or his/her likes and dislikes . This is where Active Learning (AL) comes in. Augmenting RSs with AL helps the user become more self-aware of their own likes/dislikes while at the same time providing new information to the system that it can analyze for subsequent recommendations. In essence, applying AL to RSs allows for personalization of the recommending process, a concept that makes sense as recommending is inherently geared towards personalization. This is accomplished by letting the system actively influence which items the user is exposed to (e.g. the items displayed to the user during sign-up orduring regular use), and letting the user explore his/her interests freely.},

The unknown change is treated as a change in the value of an opinion which is a model parameter, and the problem is reduced to detecting this change and its magnitude from the observed opinion share diffusion data. We solved this problem by iteratively maximizing the likelihood of generating the observed opinion share, and in doing so we devised a very efficient search algorithm which avoids parameter value optimization during the search. We tested the performance using the structures of four real world networks and confirmed that the algorithm can efficiently identify the change and outperforms the naive method, in which an exhaustive search is deployed, both in terms of accuracy and computation time.},

The ability to characterize and anticipate the key nodes, transit routes, and exchange mechanisms associated with these networks is essential to influence, disrupt, interdict or destroy the function of the networks and their processes. The complexities inherent to the characterization and anticipation of illicit nuclear trafficking networks requires that a variety of modeling and knowledge technologies be jointly harnessed to construct an effective analytical and decision making workflow in which specific case studies can be built in reasonable time and with realistic effort.

However these environments lack many of the cues that facilitate natural language processing in other conversational settings and different types of social media. Public chat data often features players who speak simultaneously, use jargon and emoticons, and only erratically adhere to conversational norms. In this paper, we present techniques for inferring the existence of social links from unstructured conversational data collected from groups of participants in the Second Life virtual world. We present an algorithm for addressing this problem, Shallow Semantic Temporal Overlap (SSTO), that combines temporal and language information to create directional links between participants, and a second approach that relies on temporal overlap alone to create undirected links between participants. Relying on temporal overlap is noisy, resulting in a low precision and networks with many extraneous links. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can ameliorate this problem by using network modularity optimization to perform community detection in the noisy networks and severing cross-community links. Although using the content of the Interacting with Computers still results in the best performance, community detection is effective as a noise reduction technique for eliminating the extra links created by temporal overlap alone.},

    abstract    = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and finally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the properties that they evaluate.},

The problem addressed in this paper is how to improve computational properties of a complex internal agent model, while preserving its behavioral properties. The problem is addressed for the case of an existing affective-cognitive decision making model instantiated for an emergency scenario. For this internal decision model an abstracted behavioral agent model is obtained, which ensures a substantial increase of the computational efficiency at the cost of approximately 1% behavioural error. The abstraction technique used can be applied to a wide range of internal agent models with loops, for example, involving mutual affective-cognitive interactions.},

In the experiments presented in the paper, we focus on the most challenging case of extreme collaborative data sparsity. We show that a low-dimensional space is suitable for recommendation generation, despite collaborative data sparsity disqualifying the use of methods widely referenced in the relevant literature. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed low-dimensional feature augmentation method is more effective than the well-known weighted feature combination method.},

To better understand and analyze a forum discussion given topic, it is important to uncover the evolution relationships (temporal dependencies) between different topic aspects (i.e. how the discussion topic is evolving). Traditional Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) techniques usually organize topics as a flat structure but it does not present the evolution relationships between topic aspects. In addition, the properties of short and sparse messages make the content-based TDT techniques difficult to perform well in identifying evolution relationships. The contributions in this paper are two-folded. We formally define a topic aspect evolution graph modeling framework and propose to utilize social network information, content similarity and temporal proximity to model evolution relationships between topic aspects. The experimental results showed that, by incorporating social network information, our technique significantly outperformed content-based technique in the task of extracting evolution relationships between topic aspects.},

Dr. Thompson will focus the talk largely on collaborative modeling related to global polio eradication and the application of system dynamics tools. After successful global eradication of wild polioviruses, live polioviruses will still present risks that could potentially lead to paralytic polio cases. This talk will present the insights of efforts to use integrated dynamic, probabilistic risk, decision, and economic models to address critical policy questions related to managing global polio risks. Using a dynamic disease transmission model combined with probabilistic model inputs that characterize uncertainty for a stratified world to account for variability, we find that global health leaders will face some difficult choices, but that they can take actions that will manage the risks effectively. The talk will emphasize the need for true collaboration between modelers and subject matter experts, and the importance of working with decision makers as partners to ensure the development of useful models that actually get used.},

We have prototyped a simple blackboard environment allowing for model docking experimentation. There are research challenges in identifying which models are appropriate to dock and the concepts that they should exchange to build a richer multi-scale view of the world. Our early approach includes docking of societal system dynamics models with individual and organizational behaviors represented in agent-based models. Case-based models allow exploration of historical knowledge by other models. Our research presents initial efforts to attain opportunistic, asynchronous interactions among multi-scale models through investigation and experimentation of knowledge-level model docking. A docked system can supply a multi-scale modeling capability to support a user's what-if analysis through combinations of case-based modeling, system dynamics approaches and agent-based models working together. An example is provided for the domain of terrorist recruiting.},

Most studies have focused on static networks, and in doing so, have neglected the temporal dynamics of the networks and communities. This paper considers the problem of tracking communities over time in dynamic social networks. We propose a method for community tracking using an adaptive evolutionary clustering framework. We apply the method to reveal the temporal evolution of communities in two real data sets. In addition, we obtain a statistic that can be used for identifying change points in the network.},

Both offenders and non-offenders (or citizens ) were modeled as agents living in neighborhoods, with a set of rules controlling changes in behavior based on individual experience. Offenders may become more or less inclined to actively commit criminal offenses, depending on the behavior of the neighborhood residents and other nearby offenders, and on their arrest experience. In turn, citizens may become more or less inclined to report crimes, based on the observed prevalence of criminal activity within their neighborhood. This paper describes the basic design and dynamics of the model, and how such models might be used to investigate practical crime intervention programs.},

Our approach grants flexibility to users by offering them multiple protecting options.

In this paper, we propose a context-aware system for mobile devices that incorporates some implicit contextual information that is scarcely used in the literature: the user's speed and his trajectory. This system has been specifically crafted to assist travelling users by providing them with smart and personalized POIs along their route taking into account their current location and driving speed.},

The recommendations generated by these systems aim to provide end users with suggestions about information items, social elements, products or services that are likely to be of their interest. The traditional syntactic-based recommender systems suffer from a number of shortcomings that hamper their effectiveness. As semantic technologies mature, they provide a consistent and reliable basis for dealing with data at the knowledge level. Adding semantically empowered techniques to recommender systems can significantly improve the overall quality of recommendations. In this work, a hybrid recommender system based on knowledge and social networks is presented. Its evaluation in the cinematographic domain yields very promising results compared to state-of-the-art solutions.},

Most Group Recommender Systems (GRSs) make use of some sort of method for aggregating the preference models of individual users to elicit a recommendation that is satisfactory for the whole group. In general, most GRSs offer good results, but each of them have only been tested in one application domain. This paper describes a domain-independent GRS that has been used in two different application domains. In order to create the group preference model, we select two techniques that are widely used in other GRSs and we compare them with two novel techniques. Our aim is to come up with a model that weighs the preferences of all the individuals to the same extent in such a way that no member in the group is particularly satisfied or dissatisfied with the final recommendations.},

    abstract    = {Research in ubiquitous location recommendation systems has focused on automatically inferring a user's preferences while little attention has been devoted to the recommendation algorithms. Location recommendation systems with a focus on recommendation algorithms generally require the user to complete complicated and time consuming surveys and rarely consider the user's current context. The purpose of this investigation is to design a more complete ubiquitous location based recommendation algorithm that by inferring user's preferences and considering time geography and similarity measurements automatically, betters the user experience. Our system learns user preferences by mining a person's social network profile. The physical constraints are delimited by a user's location, and form of transportation, which is automatically detected through the use of a decision tree followed by a discrete Hidden Markov Model. We defined a decision-making model, which considers the learned preferences, physical constraints and how the individual is currently feeling. Our recommendation algorithm is based on a text classification problem. The detection of the form of transportation and the user interface was implemented on the Nokia N900 phone, the recommendation algorithm was implemented on a server which communicates with the phone. The novelty of our approach relies on the fusion of information inferred from a user's social network profile and his/her mobile phone's sensors for place discovery. Our system is named: I'm feeling LoCo.},

@article{Verbert2012,
    abstract     = {Recommender systems have been researched extensively by the Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) community during the last decade. By identifying suitable resources from a potentially overwhelming variety of choices, such systems offer a promising approach to facilitate both learning and teaching tasks. As learning is taking place in extremely diverse and rich environments, the incorporation of contextual information about the user in the recommendation process has attracted major interest. Such contextualization is researched as a paradigm for building intelligent systems that can better predict and anticipate the needs of users, and act more efficiently in response to their behavior. In this paper, we try to assess the degree to which current work in TEL recommender systems has achieved this, as well as outline areas in which further work is needed. First, we present a context framework that identifies relevant context dimensions for TEL applications. Then, we present an analysis of existing TEL recommender systems along these dimensions. Finally, based on our survey results, we outline topics on which further research is needed.},

@article{Lu2013,
    abstract     = {The web provides excellent opportunities to businesses in various aspects of development such as finding a business partner online. However, with the rapid growth of web information, business users struggle with information overload and increasingly find it difficult to locate the right information at the right time. Meanwhile, small and medium businesses (SMBs), in particular, are seeking “one-to-one” e-services from government in current highly competitive markets. How can business users be provided with information and services specific to their needs, rather than an undifferentiated mass of information? An effective solution proposed in this study is the development of personalized e-services. Recommender systems is an effective approach for the implementation of Personalized E-Service which has gained wide exposure in e-commerce in recent years. Accordingly, this paper first presents a hybrid fuzzy semantic recommendation (HFSR) approach which combines item-based fuzzy semantic similarity and item-based fuzzy collaborative filtering (CF) similarity techniques. This paper then presents the implementation of the proposed approach into an intelligent recommendation system prototype called Smart BizSeeker, which can recommend relevant business partners to individual business users, particularly for SMBs. Experimental results show that the HFSR approach can help overcome the semantic limitations of classical CF-based recommendation approaches, namely sparsity and new “cold start” item problems.},

    abstract     = {In collaborative filtering recommender systems recommendations can be made to groups of users. There are four basic stages in the collaborative filtering algorithms where the group's users' data can be aggregated to the data of the group of users: similarity metric, establishing the neighborhood, prediction phase, determination of recommended items. In this paper we perform aggregation experiments in each of the four stages and two fundamental conclusions are reached: (1) the system accuracy does not vary significantly according to the stage where the aggregation is performed, (2) the system performance improves notably when the aggregation is performed in an earlier stage of the collaborative filtering process. This paper provides a group recommendation similarity metric and demonstrates the convenience of tackling the aggregation of the group's users in the actual similarity metric of the collaborative filtering process.},

In this paper we focus on quantitative implicit customer feedback like sales and play records data. We extend the current state-of-the-art method for recommendations based on matrix factorization under a normal distribution assumption by allowing for different distributions which are more suitable to model this kind of data. In particular, we use the Poisson, the inverse Gaussian and the gamma distribution as extensions. The experimental evaluation with three real-world data sets shows the improved performance of our approach and we demonstrate the merit of using various distributions depending on the respective data set.},

In such a process, it is very interesting to know which features of the items are more important for each user, thus the CBRS provides them higher weight. The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method is one of the most used for weighting of features, however, it does not provide the best results when the features are multi-valued. In this contribution, it is proposed a new method for obtaining the weights of the features by means of entropy and coefficients of dependency.},

In certain types of groups, it often occurs that several members do not agree on their preferences over some items so their inclusion in the group recommender system (GRS) may mislead the recommendation results. In this contribution a technique to detect and filter conflictive ratings before their use in the recommendation process is proposed and then its performance evaluated by using a well known recommendation dataset. The results show that rating filtering leads to improvements on GRSs performance.},

    abstract     = {Abstract Recommender Systems (RSs) have been extensively utilized as a means of reducing the information overload and offering travel recommendations to tourists. The emerging mobile \{RSs\} are tailored to mobile device users and promise to substantially enrich tourist experiences, recommending rich multimedia content, context-aware services, views/ratings of peer users, etc. New developments in mobile computing, wireless networking, web technologies and social networking leverage massive opportunities to provide highly accurate and effective tourist recommendations that respect personal preferences and capture usage, personal, social and environmental contextual parameters. This article follows a systematic approach in reviewing the state-of-the-art in the field, proposing a classification of mobile tourism \{RSs\} and providing insights on their offered services. It also highlights challenges and promising research directions with respect to mobile \{RSs\} employed in tourism.},

    abstract     = {Internet data are heterogeneous, redundant, disordered, and exponentially growing. Finding the right information from them becomes an ever-challenging issue. Existing technologies such as inverted index and keyword matching can list user webpage matching with given search keywords. They cannot recognize potential relations among webpages to meet some rising user needs, e.g., exploratory search and personalized search. We propose an indexing network model that organizes information in webpages at three levels: words, webpages, and categories, thereby leading to a semantic association graph. Words are used as the description of webpages and categories. Webpage classification is used to gather similar webpages together. Hyperlinks imply the wisdom of the webpage creator, which can help us generate semantic relations among categories. With a clear organizational structure, an indexing network can provide support for many important applications including intelligent information retrieval, recommendation and decision support. In order to provide access to interfaces for the proposed indexing network, an indexing network algebra is defined. Finally, to validate the proposed model, an indexing network is generated based on 30 million webpages and its structure is analyzed. We also give methods to achieve “browsing navigation” and “personalized search” based on the generated network. Results reveal that the use of an indexing network can greatly facilitate exploratory information retrieval and personalized search.},

    abstract     = {Web-page recommendation plays an important role in intelligent Web systems. Useful knowledge discovery from Web usage data and satisfactory knowledge representation for effective Web-page recommendations are crucial and challenging. This paper proposes a novel method to efficiently provide better Web-page recommendation through semantic-enhancement by integrating the domain and Web usage knowledge of a website. Two new models are proposed to represent the domain knowledge. The first model uses an ontology to represent the domain knowledge. The second model uses one automatically generated semantic network to represent domain terms, Web-pages, and the relations between them. Another new model, the conceptual prediction model, is proposed to automatically generate a semantic network of the semantic Web usage knowledge, which is the integration of domain knowledge and Web usage knowledge. A number of effective queries have been developed to query about these knowledge bases. Based on these queries, a set of recommendation strategies have been proposed to generate Web-page candidates. The recommendation results have been compared with the results obtained from an advanced existing Web Usage Mining (WUM) method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces significantly higher performance than the WUM method.},

The paper presents an approach integrating such concepts as smart space, collaborative recommendation system and context-based decision support. The key idea of the proposed approach is to implement context-based service fusion supported. This would provide a new, previously unavailable level of personalized on-board information support via generating solutions that take into account driver's preferences, information from various services as well as previous choices of users with similar interests. An application of these ideas is illustrated by an example of decision support taking into account available coupons and special offers. The system consists of several services that find, extract and process potentially useful information and provide it in a user-friendly vehicle interface. The smart space technology is used for providing interaction possibilities and interoperability of these services.},

To improve the quality of tags in software information sites, we propose EnTagRec, an automatic tag recommender based on historical tag assignments to software objects and we evaluate its performance on four software information sites, Stack Overflow, Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, and Free code. We observe that that EnTagRec achieves Recall@5 scores of 0.805, 0.815, 0.88 and 0.64, and Recall@10 scores of 0.868, 0.876, 0.944 and 0.753, on Stack Overflow, Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, and Free code, respectively.

    abstract     = {Abstract Recommender systems are effectively used as a personalized information filtering technology to automatically predict and identify a set of interesting items on behalf of users according to their personal needs and preferences. Collaborative Filtering (CF) approach is commonly used in the context of recommender systems; however, obtaining better prediction accuracy and overcoming the main limitations of the standard CF recommendation algorithms, such as sparsity and cold-start item problems, remain a significant challenge. Recent developments in personalization and recommendation techniques support the use of semantic enhanced hybrid recommender systems, which incorporate ontology-based semantic similarity measure with other recommendation approaches to improve the quality of recommendations. Consequently, this paper presents the effectiveness of utilizing semantic knowledge of items to enhance the recommendation quality. It proposes a new Inferential Ontology-based Semantic Similarity (IOBSS) measure to evaluate semantic similarity between items in a specific domain of interest by taking into account their explicit hierarchical relationships, shared attributes and implicit relationships. The paper further proposes a hybrid semantic enhanced recommendation approach by combining the new IOBSS measure and the standard item-based CF approach. A set of experiments with promising results validates the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach, using a case study of the Australian e-Government tourism services.},

Such systems have been traditionally used in diverse areas, such as e-commerce or tourism. Within this context, group recommender systems address the problem of generating recommendations for groups of users who might have different interests. Although different aggregation processes have been extensively utilized in real-life applications to generate group recommendations, such processes do not guarantee that the list of products recommended to the group reflect a high agreement level among its members' individual preferences. Given the need for considering the added value of obtaining group recommendations under a high agreement level, this paper presents a novel group recommender system methodology that attempts to reach a high level of consensus among individual recommendations of group members. To do this, and inspired by existing group decision-making approaches in the literature, a consensus reaching process is carried out to bring such individual recommendations closer to each other before delivering the group recommendations.},

This review has been conducted to identify the contextual information and methods used for making recommendations in digital libraries as well as the way researchers understood and used relevant contextual information from the years 2001 to 2013 based on the Kitchenham systematic review methodology. The results indicated that contextual information incorporated into recommendations can be categorised into three contexts, namely users' context, document's context, and environment context. In addition, the classical approaches such as collaborative filtering were employed more than the other approaches. Researchers have understood and exploited relevant contextual information through four ways, including citation of past studies, citation of past definitions, self-definitions, and field-query researches; however, citation of the past studies has been the most popular method. This review highlights the need for more investigations on the concept of context from user viewpoint in scholarly domains. It also discusses the way a context-aware recommender system can be effectively designed and implemented in digital libraries. Additionally, a few recommendations for future investigations on scholarly recommender systems are proposed.},

Firstly, the proposed method builds a collective interval linguistic preference matrix and uses likelihood-based comparison relations of intervals of linguistic terms to build a collective preference matrix for all experts. Then, based on the obtained collective preference matrix, it calculates the score of each alternative. The larger the score, the better the preference order of the alternative. Then, it calculates the consensus degree of each expert and calculates the group consensus degree of all experts. If the group consensus degree is smaller than a predefined threshold value between zero and one, then it modifies some of the intervals of linguistic terms in the interval linguistic preference matrix of the expert whose consensus degree is smaller than the group consensus degree. The above process is performed repeatedly, until the group consensus degree for all experts is larger than or equal to a predefined consensus threshold value. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of Ben-Arieh and Chen's method and Chen and Lee's method for autocratic decision making using group recommendations. It provides us with a useful way for autocratic decision making using group recommendations based on intervals of linguistic terms and likelihood-based comparison relations.},

Most content-based recommender systems use textual features to represent items and user profiles, hence they suffer from the classical problems of natural language ambiguity. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of semantic representations of items and user profiles that attempt to overcome the main problems of the simpler approaches based on keywords. We propose a classification of semantic approaches into top-down and bottom-up. The former rely on the integration of external knowledge sources, such as ontologies, encyclopedic knowledge and data from the Linked Data cloud, while the latter rely on a lightweight semantic representation based on the hypothesis that the meaning of words depends on their use in large corpora of textual documents. The chapter shows how to make recommender systems aware of semantics to realize a new generation of content-based recommenders.},

    abstract  = {One of the major challenges on Recommender Systems is how to predict users' preferences regarding contextual constraints in a group. There are situations which a user could be recommended with an appropriate item for one of their groups, but the same item may not be suitable when interacting with another user and/or group. We note that recommender systems should try to satisfy the group's demands, but it should also respect the user's individuality. We propose a conceptual architecture which uses additional information from users and items in order to build up users' profiling models according to a contextual constraint. The proposal is based on an existent hybrid recommender model that integrates user's information and item's factors into a generic latent factor model. One advantage of our model is the possibility to compute the bias on users' similarity according to the contextual constraints, that assist the group modeling, such as group of individuals who share the same content. The proposal represents the first steps towards the development of a group recommender system model, in order to introduce the concept of always-welcome recommendations.},

    abstract     = {Abstract Many trust-aware recommender systems have explored the value of explicit trust, which is specified by users with binary values and simply treated as a concept with a single aspect. However, in social science, trust is known as a complex term with multiple facets, which has not been well exploited in prior recommender systems. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by proposing a (dis)trust framework with considerations of both interpersonal and impersonal aspects of trust and distrust. Specifically, four interpersonal aspects (benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability) are computationally modeled based on users' historic ratings, while impersonal aspects are formulated from the perspective of user connections in trust networks. Two logistic regression models are developed and trained by accommodating these factors, and then applied to predict continuous values of users' trust and distrust, respectively. Trust information is further refined by corresponding predicted distrust information. The experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in further improving the performance of existing state-of-the-art trust-aware recommendation approaches.},

    abstract     = {Abstract There are plenty of expert and intelligent systems related to tourism, either for (1) selecting appropriate paths, (2) recommending routes or travel packages, (3) simulating certain implications in tourism, or (4) virtually immersing tourists. However, to the best of author's knowledge, none of these works provides a system that simulates how many tourist people sign up for each tourist route considering the features of some routes and tourists. This article presents an Agent-based Simulator (ABS) that covers this gap of the literature and is called Agent-based Simulator for Tourist Urban Routes (ABSTUR). It receives input from a set of routes and certain number of tourists with different types, and provides the number of tourist people signed up for each route after the simulation. ABSTUR has been experienced by assisting a group of tourism experts in designing a set of tourist routes in the historic center of Madrid. In this manner, experts were able to avoid collections of routes with overcrowded or non-profitable routes. ABSTUR has also proven to be efficient by comparing it with another ABS with the same specifications.},

    abstract     = {Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel virtual user strategy using precedence relations and develop a new scheme for group recommender systems. User profiles are provided in terms of the precedence relations of items as used by group members. A virtual user for a group is constructed by taking transitive precedence of items of all members into consideration. The profile of the virtual user represents the combined profile of the group. There has not been any earlier attempt to define virtual user profile using precedence relations. We show that the proposed framework exhibits many interesting properties. Earlier approaches construct virtual user profile by considering the set of common items used by all members of the group. In the present work, we propose a method of computing weightage for each item, not necessarily common to all members, using transitive precedence. We also introduce a new measure called monotonicity to measure the performance of any recommender system. In a top-k recommendation, monotonicity tries to measure the number of items continued to be recommended when a technique is utilized incrementally. We experimented extensively for different combinations of parameter settings and for different group sizes on MovieLens data. We show that our framework has better performance in terms of precision and recall when compared with other methods. We show that our recommendation framework exhibits robust monotonicity.},

Typically, financial advisors have to discuss at length with their wealthy clients and have to sift through several investment proposals before finding one able to completely meet investors' needs and constraints. As a consequence, a recent trend in wealth management is to improve the advisory process by exploiting recommendation technologies. This paper proposes a framework for recommendation of asset allocation strategies which combines case-based reasoning with a novel diversification strategy to support financial advisors in the task of proposing diverse and personalized investment portfolios. The performance of the framework has been evaluated by means of an experimental session conducted against 1172 real users, and results show that the yield obtained by recommended portfolios overcomes that of portfolios proposed by human advisors in most experimental settings while meeting the preferred risk profile. Furthermore, our diversification strategy shows promising results in terms of both diversity and average yield.},

    abstract     = {Abstract Recommender system (RS) is a special type of information systems that assists decision makers to choose appropriate items according to their preferences and interests. It is utilized in different domains to personalize its applications by recommending items, such as books, movies, songs, restaurants, news articles, jokes, among others. An important issue in \{RS\} namely the new user cold-start problem occurring when a new user migrates to the system has grasped a great attraction of researchers in recent years. Existing researches are faced with the limitations of the relied dataset, the determination of the optimal number of clusters, the similarity metric, irrelevant users and the selection of membership values. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid method so-called HU-FCF++ to deal with these drawbacks by considering the integration of existing state-of-the-arts of several groups of methods in order to combine the advantages of different groups and eliminate their disadvantages by some special procedures. A numerical example on a simulated dataset is given to illustrate the activities of the proposed approach. Experimental validation on the benchmark \{RS\} datasets show that HU-FCF++ achieves better accuracy than the relevant methods.},

    abstract     = {Abstract Social Networking Sites (SNSs) have become mainstream and increasingly attract research and managerial attention. However, there is a lack of research on the social factors that determine consumers' loyalty to SNSs. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to develop and estimate a conceptual model of how different aspects of social and parasocial relationships developed in social networking sites influence consumers' loyalty. The paper examines how parasocial relationships consumers developed with SNSs members precede and contribute to the creation of social relationships expressed as (a) identification with the SNS group and (b) engagement with the SNS group which in turn lead to (c) SNS related behavioral intentions and (d) SNS loyalty. This is one of the few studies available in the literature that takes a social approach in the study of SNSs and examines the applicability of theories developed offline in the online social environment of SNSs. The proposed hypotheses are tested by estimating a structural equation model with survey data from a convenience sample of 320 members of various online social networks. The findings of the study partially confirm the proposed conceptual sequence of effects and provide important theoretical and practical implications.},

    abstract     = {The rapid development of e-learning systems provides learners with great opportunities to access learning activities online, and this greatly supports and enhances the learning practices. However, an issue reduces the success of application of e-learning systems; too many learning activities (such as various leaning materials, subjects, and learning resources) are emerging in an e-learning system, making it difficult for individual learners to select proper activities for their particular situations/requirements because there is no personalized service function. Recommender systems, which aim to provide personalized recommendations for products or services, can be used to solve this issue. However, e-learning systems need to be able to handle certain special requirements: 1) leaning activities and learners' profiles often present tree structures; 2) learning activities contain vague and uncertain data, such as the uncertain categories that the learning activities belong to; 3) there are pedagogical issues, such as the precedence relations between learning activities. To deal with the three requirements, this study first proposes a fuzzy tree-structured learning activity model, and a learner profile model to comprehensively describe the complex learning activities and learner profiles. In the two models, fuzzy category trees and related similarity measures are presented to infer the semantic relations between learning activities or learner requirements. Since it is impossible to have two completely same trees, in practice, a fuzzy tree matching method is carefully discussed. A fuzzy tree matching-based hybrid learning activity recommendation approach is then developed. This approach takes advantage of both the knowledge-based and collaborative filtering-based recommendation approaches, and considers both the semantic and collaborative filtering similarities between learners. Finally, an e-learning recommender system prototype is well designed and developed based on- the proposed models and recommendation approach. Experiments are done to evaluate the proposed recommendation approach, and the experimental results demonstrate the good accuracy performance of the proposed approach. A comprehensive case study about learning activity recommendation further demonstrates the effectiveness of the fuzzy tree matching-based personalized e-learning recommender system in practice.},

    abstract     = {With the recent surge of location based social networks (LBSNs), activity data of millions of users has become attainable. This data contains not only spatial and temporal stamps of user activity, but also its semantic information. LBSNs can help to understand mobile users' spatial temporal activity preference (STAP), which can enable a wide range of ubiquitous applications, such as personalized context-aware location recommendation and group-oriented advertisement. However, modeling such user-specific STAP needs to tackle high-dimensional data, i.e., user-location-time-activity quadruples, which is complicated and usually suffers from a data sparsity problem. In order to address this problem, we propose a STAP model. It first models the spatial and temporal activity preference separately, and then uses a principle way to combine them for preference inference. In order to characterize the impact of spatial features on user activity preference, we propose the notion of personal functional region and related parameters to model and infer user spatial activity preference. In order to model the user temporal activity preference with sparse user activity data in LBSNs, we propose to exploit the temporal activity similarity among different users and apply nonnegative tensor factorization to collaboratively infer temporal activity preference. Finally, we put forward a context-aware fusion framework to combine the spatial and temporal activity preference models for preference inference. We evaluate our proposed approach on three real-world datasets collected from New York and Tokyo, and show that our STAP model consistently outperforms the baseline approaches in various settings.},

This study proposes a hybrid, trust-based recommender system to mitigate above learning issues in online CoPs. A case study was conducted using Stack Overflow data to test the recommender system. Important findings include: (1) comparing with other social community platforms, learners in online CoPs have stronger social relations and tend to interact with a smaller group of people only; (2) the hybrid algorithm can provide more accurate recommendations than celebrity-based and content-based algorithm and; (3) the proposed recommender system can facilitate the formation of personalized learning communities.},

Messages received by a user mainly depend on whom the user follows. Thus, recommending users with similar interests may improve the experience quality for information receiving. Since messages posted by microblogging users reflect their interests, and the keywords in the messages indicate their main focus to a large extent, we can discover users' preferences by analyzing the user-generated contents. Moreover, users' interests are not static, on the contrary, they change as time goes by. Based on such intuitions, in this paper, we propose a temporal-topic model to analyze users' possible behaviors and predict their potential friends in microblogging. The model learns users' latent preferences by extracting keywords on aggregated messages over a period of time via a topic model, and then the impact of time is considered to deal with interest drifts. The experimental results of friend recommendations on Sina Weibo, one of the most popular microblogging sites in China, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.},

    abstract     = {Traditional recommender systems provide personal suggestions based on the user's preferences, without taking into account any additional contextual information, such as time or device type. The added value of contextual information for the recommendation process is highly dependent on the application domain, the type of contextual information, and variations in users' usage behavior in different contextual situations. This paper investigates whether users utilize a mobile news service in different contextual situations and whether the context has an influence on their consumption behavior. Furthermore, the importance of context for the recommendation process is investigated by comparing the user satisfaction with recommendations based on an explicit static profile, content-based recommendations using the actual user behavior but ignoring the context, and context-aware content-based recommendations incorporating user behavior as well as context. Considering the recommendations based on the static profile as a reference condition, the results indicate a significant improvement for recommendations that are based on the actual user behavior. This improvement is due to the discrepancy between explicitly stated preferences (initial profile) and the actual consumption behavior of the user. The context-aware content-based recommendations did not significantly outperform the content-based recommendations in our user study. Context-aware content-based recommendations may induce a higher user satisfaction after a longer period of service operation, enabling the recommender to overcome the cold-start problem and distinguish user preferences in various contextual situations.},

Issues related to group recommendations are increasingly becoming hot research topics. Among differences between individual and group recommender systems, the most significant one is social factors of group users. Social factors, including personality, expertise factor, interpersonal relationships, and preference similarities, widen the gap between group and individual recommendations. Here, a new approach focusing on the impact of social factors on group recommender systems is proposed. A computational model integrating the influences of personality, expertise factor, interpersonal relationships, and preference similarities is described in detail. Comparative experiments are conducted on two datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can provide more accurate and satisfactory group recommendations, especially when social influences are significant.},

    abstract     = {With the exponential development of the number of users browsing the internet, an important factor that now the developer community is focussing on is the user experience. Recommender systems are the platforms that make personalized recommendations for a particular user by predicting the ratings for various items. Recommender systems majorly ignore the sequential information and rather focus on content information, but sequential information also provides much information about the behavior of the user. In this research work, we have presented a novel web-based recommender system which is based on sequential information of user's navigation on web pages. We received top-N clusters when Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering is employed. We determined the similar users for the target user and also evaluated the weight for each web page. We have tried to solve that problem of recommender systems as we offered a system to forecast a user's next Web page visit. In our work, we proposed a system which generates recommendations to the users, by considering the sequential information that exists in their usage patterns of Web pages. We employed fuzzy clustering to give recommender system a sequential approach. We calculated weights for each page category considered in our system and predict top page recommendation for the target user. The real-world dataset of MNSBC is used in the experiments. The dataset consists of 5000 user entries with 6, entries per user. When we performed a comparison between the existing model with our proposed model, then it clearly showed that the accuracy of the proposed model is almost three times better than some existing systems. The accuracy of our proposed model is nearly 33 {\%}.},

    abstract     = {Abstract Recommender systems use past behaviors of users to suggest items. Most tend to offer items similar to the items that a target user has indicated as interesting. As a result, users become bored with obvious suggestions that they might have already discovered. To improve user satisfaction, recommender systems should offer serendipitous suggestions: items not only relevant and novel to the target user, but also significantly different from the items that the user has rated. However, the concept of serendipity is very subjective and serendipitous encounters are very rare in real-world scenarios, which makes serendipitous recommendations extremely difficult to study. To date, various definitions and evaluation metrics to measure serendipity have been proposed, and there is no wide consensus on which definition and evaluation metric to use. In this paper, we summarize most important approaches to serendipity in recommender systems, compare different definitions and formalizations of the concept, discuss serendipity-oriented recommendation algorithms and evaluation strategies to assess the algorithms, and provide future research directions based on the reviewed literature.},

    abstract     = {A group of people is often required to reach a joint decision and choose a single activity in which they will all participate. Members of such group often interact via online social networks. Group decision making requires knowledge of members' preferences; however, in many cases the members' preferences are not fully available. We consider a scenario where preferences are known only partially and present a group decision support framework that determines a single winning item using a voting procedure while minimizing the number of queries for members' preferences. The framework uses a probabilistic algorithm based on the social similarity among the group members. To evaluate our framework we have built LetsDoIt, a decision support system prototype for leisure actives. We compared several types of groups and prediction methods and reveal that for groups with high internal social similarity, the algorithm reaches a decision using fewer queries, and thus less communication with the users is required. Moreover, the runtime of the algorithms using social based prediction methods is less than half that of the algorithm using rating based prediction methods. These results suggest that incorporating social similarity data, when available, can be of value.},

Several group recommender systems have been proposed by extending traditional \{KNN\} based Collaborative Filtering. In this paper we explain how to perform group recommendations using Matrix Factorization (MF) based Collaborative Filtering (CF). We propose three original approaches to map the group of users to the latent factor space and compare the proposed methods in three different scenarios: when the group size is small, medium and large. We also compare the precision of the proposed methods with state-of-the-art group recommendation systems using \{KNN\} based Collaborative Filtering. We analyze group movie ratings on MovieLens and Netflix datasets. Our study demonstrates that the performance of group recommender systems varies depending on the size of the group, and \{MF\} based \{CF\} is the best option for group recommender systems.},

    abstract     = {In recommender systems user preferences can be fairly dynamic, as users tend to exploit a wide range of items and modify their tastes accordingly over time. In this paper, we model user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. UPD shows the variability in how users interact with items in recommender systems. We generate recommendations based on a tensor factorization technique, where the importance of past user preferences are weighted according to their UPD values, that is, higher UPD values downweigh more past user preferences. Additionally, we exploit users' side data, such as demographics, which improve the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses two real benchmark datasets from the social media platforms Last.fm and MovieLens, containing users' history records pertaining to listening to songs and viewing movies, respectively. We demonstrate that in both datasets, there are users with a varying level of dynamics, expressed by the UPD metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baselines, by taking into account both dynamics and side data of users.},

    abstract  = {The pervasive use of web technologies and online cooperation tools is posing new challenges in the design of recommender systems, requiring now a rapid move from individual to group recommendations. In this paper, a multi-agent system to provide support to small groups of users in their decisionmaking process is presented. In detail, the addressed problem is to find a common solution for a group, represented by a set of activities in the touristic domain, among a huge set of possible alternatives, that meets the preferences of each member. The proposed system uses an automatic negotiation process that incrementally builds a candidate solution for the whole group according to the individual lists of each group member. Since the negotiation mechanism involves the real users to take part in the decision-making process, the proposed approach tries to limit the agreement search space during the negotiation process in order to minimize the user direct intervention. The proposed solution relies on negotiating agents that simulate the users' behavior while trading by using different conflict resolution styles, obtained by applying the Thomas Kilmann model. The results obtained with both simulated and real users' behavior show that the proposed system achieves a high probability of success, finding a shared solution, in most cases, in a relatively small number of rounds of negotiation. In addition, end users were satisfied with the received recommendations.},

    abstract     = {Abstract A recommender system is used in various fields to recommend items of interest to the users. Most recommender approaches focus only on the users and items to make the recommendations. However, in many applications, it is also important to incorporate contextual information into the recommendation process. Although the use of contextual information has received great focus in recent years, there is a lack of automatic methods to obtain such information for context-aware recommender systems. Some works address this problem by proposing supervised methods, which require greater human effort and whose results are not so satisfactory. In this scenario, we propose an unsupervised method to extract contextual information from web page content. Our method builds topic hierarchies from page textual content considering, besides the traditional bag-of-words, valuable information of texts as named entities and domain terms (privileged information). The topics extracted from the hierarchies are used as contextual information in context-aware recommender systems. We conducted experiments by using two data sets and two baselines: the first baseline is a recommendation system that does not use contextual information and the second baseline is a method proposed in literature to extract contextual information. The results are, in general, very good and present significant gains. In conclusion, our method has advantages and innovations:(i) it is unsupervised; (ii) it considers the context of the item (Web page), instead of the context of the user as in most of the few existing methods, which is an innovation; (iii) it uses privileged information in addition to the existing technical information from pages; and (iv) it presented good and promising empirical results. This work represents an advance in the state-of-the-art in context extraction, which means an important contribution to context-aware recommender systems, a kind of specialized and intelligent system.},

    abstract     = {Abstract Developing group recommender systems (GRSs) is a vital requirement in many online service systems to provide recommendations in contexts in which a group of users are involved. Unfortunately, GRSs cannot be effectively supported using traditional individual recommendation techniques because it needs new models to reach an agreement to satisfy all the members of this group, given their conflicting preferences. Our goal is to generate recommendations by taking each group member's contribution into account through weighting members according to their degrees of importance. To achieve this goal, we first propose a member contribution score (MCS) model, which employs the separable non-negative matrix factorization technique on a group rating matrix, to analyze the degree of importance of each member. A Manhattan distance-based local average rating (MLA) model is then developed to refine predictions by addressing the fat tail problem. By integrating the MCS and MLA models, a member contribution-based group recommendation (MC-GR) approach is developed. Experiments show that our MC-GR approach achieves a significant improvement in the performance of group recommendations. Lastly, using the MC-GR approach, we develop a group recommender system called GroTo that can effectively recommend activities to web-based tourist groups.},

    abstract     = {Webpage recommendations for hot Web events can assist people to easily follow the evolution of these Web events. At the same time, there are different levels of semantic uncertainty underlying the amount of Webpages for a Web event, such as recapitulative information and detailed information. Apparently, the grasp of the semantic uncertainty of Web events could improve the satisfactoriness of Webpage recommendations. However, traditional hit-rate-based or clustering-based Webpage recommendation methods have overlooked these different levels of semantic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a framework to identify the different underlying levels of semantic uncertainty in terms of Web events, and then utilize these for Webpage recommendations. Our idea is to consider a Web event as a system composed of different keywords, and the uncertainty of this keyword system is related to the uncertainty of the particular Web event. Based on keyword association linked network Web event representation and Shannon entropy, we identify the different levels of semantic uncertainty, and construct a semantic pyramid (SP) to express the uncertainty hierarchy of a Web event. Finally, an SP-based Webpage recommendation system is developed. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can significantly capture the different levels of the semantic uncertainties of Web events and it can be applied to Webpage recommendations.},

    abstract     = {The intelligent recognition of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has become an important approach to the detection of epilepsy. Among existing intelligent identification methods, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) have shown a distinctive advantage in identifying epileptic EEG signals because of their strong learning abilities and interpretability. Like many conventional intelligent methods for recognizing EEG signals, in the training of FLS, it is assumed that the training dataset and test dataset are drawn from data that are identically distributed. However, this assumption is not necessarily valid in practice as it is not uncommon for the two datasets to have different distributions. To overcome this problem, a strategy is presented in this paper to construct a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) FLS based on transductive transfer learning for identifying epileptic EEG signals. Two novel objective functions, achieved by integrating the transductive transfer learning mechanism, are proposed for the training of the TSK FLS. As regression and binary classification are two common approaches to multiclass classification, the TSK transfer learning FLS algorithms for regression and binary classification are developed, respectively, to construct the corresponding TSK FLS. Both algorithms are further used to perform a multiclass classification to recognize epileptic EEG signals. Their performance in the epileptic EEG datasets indicates promise in dealing with situations where the training and test datasets differ with regard to data distribution.},

    abstract     = {Abstract Group recommender systems (GRSs) filter relevant items to groups of users in overloaded search spaces using information about their preferences. When the feedback is explicitly given by the users, inconsistencies may be introduced due to various factors, known as natural noise. Previous research on individual recommendation has demonstrated that natural noise negatively influences the recommendation accuracy, whilst it improves when noise is managed. \{GRSs\} also employ explicit ratings given by several users as ground truth, hence the recommendation process is also affected by natural noise. However, the natural noise problem has not been addressed on GRSs. The aim of this paper is to develop and test a model to diminish its negative effect in GRSs. A case study will evaluate the results of different approaches, showing that managing the natural noise at different rating levels reduces prediction error. Eventually, the deployment of a \{GRS\} with natural noise management is analysed.},

    abstract     = {Recently, food recommender systems have received increasing attention due to their relevance for healthy living. Most existing studies on the food domain focus on recommendations that suggest proper food items for individual users on the basis of considering their preferences or health problems. These systems also provide functionalities to keep track of nutritional consumption as well as to persuade users to change their eating behavior in positive ways. Also, group recommendation functionalities are very useful in the food domain, especially when a group of users wants to have a dinner together at home or have a birthday party in a restaurant. Such scenarios create many challenges for food recommender systems since the preferences of all group members have to be taken into account in an adequate fashion. In this paper, we present an overview of recommendation techniques for individuals and groups in the healthy food domain. In addition, we analyze the existing state-of-the-art in food recommender systems and discuss research challenges related to the development of future food recommendation technologies.},

abstract = { This paper examines new para-journalism forms such as micro-blogging as “awareness systems” that provide journalists with more complex ways of understanding and reporting on the subtleties of public communication. Traditional journalism defines fact as information and quotes from official sources, which have been identified as forming the vast majority of news and information content. This model of news is in flux, however, as new social media technologies such as Twitter facilitate the instant, online dissemination of short fragments of information from a variety of official and unofficial sources. This paper draws from computer science literature to suggest that these broad, asynchronous, lightweight and always-on systems are enabling citizens to maintain a mental model of news and events around them, giving rise to awareness systems that the paper describes as ambient journalism. The emergence of ambient journalism brought about by the use of these new digital delivery systems and evolving communications protocols raises significant research questions for journalism scholars and professionals. This research offers an initial exploration of the impact of awareness systems on journalism norms and practices. It suggests that one of the future directions for journalism may be to develop approaches and systems that help the public negotiate and regulate the flow of awareness information, facilitating the collection and transmission of news. }

Since, the largest cQA services maintain massive sets of resolved questions, the necessity for effective methods to revitalize the information contained in their archives is getting more and more important to serve the needs of their members as promptly and as reliably as possible. In this paper, we present a novel strategy for effectively browsing cQA archives. The core idea is to induce the semantic classes of question-like search queries (e.g., “rib pain after ovulation” and “iron oxide household”) by means of the contextual information set up or represented by inferred views of their respective search sessions, namely views modeling previous queries entered by the same user. When searching cQA archives, members do not associate semantic classes to their queries, so we are considering the cQA as a knowledge base that defines a taxonomy of semantic classes for their posted questions, which provides an explicit mapping between search queries and these questions. Following a supervised learning approach, we investigate and analyze the most salient features that are necessary to automatically exploit this relevant cQA mapping. We carried out a large number of experiments using a rich set of attributes extracted from an automatically acquired big dataset from Yahoo! Answers. Our results confirm what was often only intuitively assumed, namely, that larger contexts actually help to detect semantic relations implicitly expressed in sequences of queries submitted by users during their search sessions. In particular, we discover that Explicit Semantic Analysis is extremely helpful for inferring discriminative semantic cues that reduce, and thus determine, the semantic range of question-like search queries. Conversely, constructing traditional bag-of-words models on top of prior queries in the session was detrimental."

Recent trends demonstrate the urgent need to manage the large amounts of data stream, especially in specific domains of application such as critical infrastructure systems, sensor networks, log file analysis, search engines and more recently, social networks. All of these applications involve large-scale data-intensive tasks, often subject to time constraints and space complexity. Algorithms, data management and data retrieval techniques must be able to process data stream, i.e., process data as it becomes available and provide an accurate response, based solely on the data stream that has already been provided. Data retrieval techniques often require traditional data storage and processing approach, i.e., all data must be available in the storage space in order to be processed. For instance, a widely used relevance measure is Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF), which can evaluate how important a word is in a collection of documents and requires to a priori know the whole dataset. To address this problem, we propose an approximate version of the TF–IDF measure suitable to work on continuous data stream (such as the exchange of messages, tweets and sensor-based log files). The algorithm for the calculation of this measure makes two assumptions: a fast response is required, and memory is both limited and infinitely smaller than the size of the data stream. In addition, to face the great computational power required to process massive data stream, we present also a parallel implementation of the approximate TF–IDF calculation using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). This implementation of the algorithm was tested on generated and real data stream and was able to capture the most frequent terms. Our results demonstrate that the approximate version of the TF–IDF measure performs at a level that is comparable to the solution of the precise TF–IDF measure."

The actual application of this model in the big data domain is not feasible due to time and memory restrictions. Several distributed alternatives based on MapReduce have been proposed to enable this method to handle large-scale data. However, their performance can be further improved with new designs that fit with newly arising technologies. In this work we provide a new solution to perform an exact k-nearest neighbor classification based on Spark. We take advantage of its in-memory operations to classify big amounts of unseen cases against a big training dataset. The map phase computes the k-nearest neighbors in different training data splits. Afterwards, multiple reducers process the definitive neighbors from the list obtained in the map phase. The key point of this proposal lies on the management of the test set, keeping it in memory when possible. Otherwise, it is split into a minimum number of pieces, applying a MapReduce per chunk, using the caching skills of Spark to reuse the previously partitioned training set. In our experiments we study the differences between Hadoop and Spark implementations with datasets up to 11 million instances, showing the scaling-up capabilities of the proposed approach. As a result of this work an open-source Spark package is available."

It has been also important to consider the trade-off between the accuracy and the computation time in recommending the items by the recommender systems as they need to produce the recommendations accurately and meanwhile in real-time. In this regard, this research develops a new hybrid recommendation method based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches. Accordingly, in this research we solve two main drawbacks of recommender systems, sparsity and scalability, using dimensionality reduction and ontology techniques. Then, we use ontology to improve the accuracy of recommendations in CF part. In the CF part, we also use a dimensionality reduction technique, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to find the most similar items and users in each cluster of items and users which can significantly improve the scalability of the recommendation method. We evaluate the method on two real-world datasets to show its effectiveness and compare the results with the results of methods in the literature. The results showed that our method is effective in improving the sparsity and scalability problems in CF."

Therefore, how to incorporate the trust relationship in social networks with user feedback for service recommendation motivates this work. In this paper, we propose a social network-based service recommendation method with trust enhancement known as RelevantTrustWalker. First, a matrix factorization method is utilized to assess the degree of trust between users in social network. Next, an extended random walk algorithm is proposed to obtain recommendation results. To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, experiments on a real-world dataset are conducted and experimental results indicate that the quality of the recommendation and the speed of the method are improved compared with existing algorithms."

abstract="The collaborative filtering (CF) approach to recommenders has recently enjoyed much interest and progress. The fact that it played a central role within the recently completed Netflix competition has contributed to its popularity. This chapter surveys the recent progress in the field. Matrix factorization techniques, which became a first choice for implementing CF, are described together with recent innovations. We also describe several extensions that bring competitive accuracy into neighborhood methods, which used to dominate the field. The chapter demonstrates how to utilize temporal models and implicit feedback to extend models accuracy. In passing, we include detailed descriptions of some the central methods developed for tackling the challenge of the Netflix Prize competition.",
